> At 3:30 am, [deadname] was shot once in the back near West Clay in Montrose, before he stumbled to the block of 600 West Bell near Stanford and collapsed, police said. Neighbors returning from a party found him about 2 hours later, authorities said. Investigators initially thought it was a hate crime because the person was a [trans woman] in full women's clothing, jewelry, makeup, and had shoulder-length hair, but evidence pointed to a crime that police believe was related to something else other than a hate crime.
>
> The killer was never found, and the case remains open. Garcia was buried by family members later that week.
