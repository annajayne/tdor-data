Tracy Thompson,33,,1999_03_30_Tracy-Thompson.jpg,https://criminaldigest.medium.com/tracy-thompson-9f167e46795b,30-Mar-1999,"tdor.info/30 Mar 1999/Tracy Thompson (aka Tracy Turner, Billy Joe Turner)",,,Cordele,Georgia,USA,31.969116,-83.782663,violence,beaten,"Tracy died from head injuries, most likely caused by a baseball bat.

> Before daybreak on March 30, 1999, Tracey Thompson stumbled up to a house in tiny Seville, Ga. and banged on the door. Bleeding from the head, she asked for water, a blanket and a place to rest. The residents called 911 and some 10 hours after Thompson arrived at a local hospital she was dead.
> 
> Eighteen years later, her killing remains unsolved. Authorities are still searching for a break in the case which, at the time, attracted national attention because Thompson — also known as [deadname] Turner — was transgender.
> 
> On a dirt road about a half mile from the farmhouse where Thompson sought help, authorities found blood and shattered pieces of a baseball bat. But it didn’t lead them to the killer.
> 
> A drifter known to hitchhike across Georgia’s interstates and spend time at truck stops, Thompson lived on the fringes. She had a long criminal history for non-violent charges such as criminal trespass and drunken driving and served some time in prison for theft, Weathersby said.
>
> Thompson was from Dalton in north Georgia, although she also had lived in Miami and Ft. Meyers, Florida, Weathersby said. How she ended up in in a rural area — some 75 miles south of Macon — is unknown. But relatives and friends told authorities Thompson would visit friends and family in Florida, sometimes staying six months to a year. It wasn’t unusual for her to hitchhike on the interstates accessible to Dalton and Wilcox County, Weathersby said.
>
> On her death bed, Thompson told authorities she’d been struck repeatedly with a baseball bat by an ex-boyfriend. But agents tracked him down and learned he was out of town at the time. He’s been ruled out as a suspect, Weathersby said.
