Some reports state that she had been tied up and shot.

> Another Black trans woman has been murdered, this time in Clewiston, Florida. Her name was Bee Love. She was 21 years old, just a week away from her 22nd birthday.  Clewiston is part of the Florida Heartland, a region closer to the Deep South than coastal Florida cities. It has been just 24 hours since we reported on the murder of 17-year-old Bailey Reeves in Baltimore. Our young people are dying at horrifying rates. Where is our progressive movement?
>
> 18 deaths. 17 have been Black trans women. 10 have been under the age of 23, 17 out of the 18 were under the age of 31. This is sickening and heartwrenching. And it doesn’t show any sign of stopping.
>
> Local media are simply reporting on the discovery of an unidentified body in a burned vehicle. Other reports indicate Bee’s body had multiple gunshot wounds and that she may have been tied up in the front seat of the vehicle.
>
> **HENDRY COUNTY, Fla. – Early Wednesday morning, Hendry County deputies found a body in a burned vehicle They received a call about a vehicle fire near 13th Street and Virginia Avenue, Harlem, in the Clewiston area, according to a Hendry County Sheriff’s Office news release. Then, they found a body inside. Investigators said the body in the vehicle was burned beyond recognition. **
>
> Friends and trans activists are raising a hue and cry about the need for media coverage and for public information on the investigation. They are outraged that Bee’s death isn’t being more widely investigated.**
>
> Friends have organized a vigil on Friday, September 6, 2019 at 7:30 PM. The location is Fremd Villages in Pahokee, Florida.

Friends and neighbours believe her murder was a targeted attack.
 
> *Transgender woman in Hendry County may have died in targeted attack*
>
> One man said his best friend was the one found inside a burned car in Hendry County. He believes the woman was targeted because she was transgender.
>
> Kenard Wade tells WINK News he last saw his best friend Sunday. He talked to her the night he thinks she died.
>
> Charred grass is seen around the vehicle that went up in flames. Many people in the community said it was a targeted attack, including Keisha Whittaker.
> “To me, it’s very devastating to know that life happens that way,” Whittaker said.
>
> The suspected death is unsettling for many people in the Hendry County neighborhood. All that is left is a burned off patch of grass and scattered car parts. Davarin Harris saw the smoke from his front yard. He said he knew a car was on fire. However, he did not expect a body inside of it.
>
> Wade said his best friend is the one whom Hendry County Sheriff’s Office Deputies found dead.
>
> ”That’s her car,” said Wade with visible pain. “I know that. I know her car.”
>
> Wade told us the two had known each other for six years and that his best friend was not afraid of anyone who did not agree with her lifestyle. But Wade said someone wanted to harm her. In text messages the night of the car fire, the victim knew it. The woman told him she wanted to leave town. She was expecting to get in trouble if she stayed here.

Subsequently  Jamson Richemond, 29, was identified as a person of interest.

> Update (September 26, 2019): A person of interest has been identified in the killing of 23-year-old Bee Love Slater. 
>
> According to the Hendry County Sheriff’s Office in Florida, Jamson Richemond, 29, is now wanted in connection to Slater’s death.
>
> The 23-year-old Black trans woman was found “burned beyond recognition” inside of a charred vehicle in South Florida on September 4. Sheriff Steve Whidden described the situation as “gruesome” and said Slater was believed to have been targeted based on her sexual identity, New York Daily Newsreported.  
>
> According to NBC 2, investigators are looking into a Facebook post shared before Slater’s death that said, “Somebody needs to kill Bee Love.”

In December 2021 Marcus Lynell Thompson, 35, was arrested in connection with the case. He faces charges of first-degree murder and arson.

> ABELLE, Fla. (AP) | Florida sheriff’s deputies have arrested a man in connection with the slaying of a transgender woman whose body was found more than two years ago in her burning car.
>
> The Hendry County Sheriff’s Office said Marcus Lynell Thompson, 35, is charged with being an accessory after the fact to first-degree murder and arson in the killing of 23-year-old Bee Love Slater.
>
> Detectives did not reveal more details or the motive of the killing at a press conference but said they were confident they were going to solve the murder and there would be more arrests. It is not yet clear if Thompson knew Slater.
>
> Media reports the FBI helped detectives, investigating the case as a hate crime because of Slater’s gender identity. At the press conference, the sheriff’s office didn’t say whether the slaying was considered a hate crime.

>
> Despite the lack of media attention, the death of the reportedly transgender young man — identified by a GoFundMe memorial as Yaeli Galdamez/Andrew Elijah Martinez — has prompted Los Angeles County leaders to conduct an immediate investigation into what they labelled as systemic issues in services for LGBTQ foster youth that could have prevented the death.

> “Andrew M.’s death must be met with urgency to provide youth, including transition age youth in foster care, identified as LGBTQ+ with support and resources to live proud, productive, happy lives,” according to a motion proposed by Los Angeles County Supervisors Hilda Solis and Sheila Kuehl that will be introduced at the supervisors’ meeting on Tuesday.
>
> The motion also calls for strengthening services such as more training for caregivers as well as providers across the region, and to find ways to minimize family rejection of youth who identify as LGBTQ. The need for specialized service for LGBTQ youth will also be discussed at a Monday meeting of the Los Angeles County Children’s Commission.

> **""And 20 years later, not much has changed, but something has changed. I am proud to have been present and part of some changes, but it is not enough. More needs to be done and that is why I am now struggling: for the depathologization of transsexuality and transgender identities, and for a true Gender Identity Law, in which we have full rights over our true identity and body.""** - Lara Crespo, October 2016

> Like Lara Crespo, we also have the notion of the way to go, in terms of homophobic and transphobic social representations. Therefore, continued awareness-raising work is needed to defend LGBTI rights and fight against discrimination, based on prejudice, fear and ignorance, which prevent the desired change of mindset.

The circumstances of her death have not yet been confirmed.

> A Black transgender woman named Elisha Chanel Stanley — better known to some as Elisha Diamond — was found dead in Downtown Pittsburgh on Sept. 16.
>
> The circumstances of Stanley’s death have not yet been determined by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner. But two weeks after her death, posts on social media claiming foul play went viral on Mon., Sept. 30, and DeVar Ferguson — a close friend of Stanley's —  believes her death is suspicious. According to Ferguson, Stanley was meant to attend a gathering Saturday evening, but never showed.
>
> Chris Togneri, public information officer for Pittsburgh’s department of safety, confirmed there is an open investigation into her death but declined to provide any further comment in an email Tuesday afternoon.
>
> According to the Allegheny County Medical Examiner’s report, the victim was found deceased at the scene on Mon., Sept. 16, around 6:30 p.m., on the 1000 Block of Penn Ave., Downtown. (That address is listed as The Westin Pittsburgh hotel.) Stanley was listed on the report as a 46, female Black or African-American resident of Washington, D.C.

Elisha was a professional mental health care worker who was working for MBI Health Services LLC in Washington DC. She had gone back to Pittsburgh to be with family.

> Stanley was in Pittsburgh to visit some close friends, according to Ferguson, including themself and another of her “children."" Ferguson describes Stanley as their “gay mother.”
>
> “People don’t really understand where that term comes from,” Ferguson says. “There are a lot of runaways, and displaced and abused people in the community. Without being funded by any government organization, there are people [in this community] who have taken these people on and moved them in, clothed them, fed them, taken them to school, and really played that part as a mentor in their lives and those are all the things she did for me.”
>
> Stanley and Ferguson first met in the late '90s. At the time, Ferguson says Stanley allowed them to move in while they were living in a shelter after having been kicked out. In 2002, Stanley moved to D.C. to “become the woman she wanted to be from the inside out,” and Ferguson moved with her. Ferguson returned to Pittsburgh in 2005 and now is a father in the way Stanley was a mother to them.
>
> “She was my friend, someone who protected me, there was nothing she wouldn’t do for someone. She took me in and loved me like her own flesh and blood,” says Ferguson. “She spent her life opening doors for women like herself.”

In November 2019 Samuel de Carvalho, 35, was indicted for Médely's murder.

> The Homicide and Protection of Persons Sector (SHPP) of the Mogi das Cruzes Police Dept. (Demacro) has indicted 35-year-old Samuel de Carvalho for the murder of 15-year-old transgender adolescent [possible deadname] da Silva Bezerra Santos. The crime occurred two months ago, in the Estância Guatambu neighborhood of Itaquaquecetuba. The accused had the temporary arrest decreed on the morning of Thursday (21). He will be tried for double-qualified murder and body concealment, and can be sentenced to 30 years in private jail.
>
> According to the SHPP, the man was classified as ""one of the most dangerous criminals in Alto Tietê"". He has a vast criminal record involving drug trafficking, theft and theft. He was currently also being investigated for a rape and has been convicted of murder - robbery followed by death.
>
> [Médely] was killed around 10 pm on September 19. [Their] body was found naked and gagged on a wasteland located on Pinheirinho Road, near the Ayrton Senna highway. Forensic evidence showed that the victim was raped and pointed to the cause of death as mechanical strangulation.
>
> According to Rubens José Angelo, chief deputy who investigated the case, the perpetrator was located after intense investigative work. “This is a cold, calculating and extremely dangerous person who needed to be removed from society,” he says.
>
> Images from area security cameras showed the perpetrator and the victim walking together toward the crime scene terrain. Samuel left the scene alone about 50 minutes later. The recordings were presented to witnesses, who confirmed the identity of the accused.
>
> According to the team, the man confessed to knowing the victim and being present at the crime scene. The motivations of the crime are not clear to the team, which does not rule out possible homophobic connotations. The accused's modus operanti, who was already investigated for strangling victims during the rape, was acknowledged in the incident. Samuel denies involvement in the case, but did not allow his genetic material to be collected for analysis.

Although she had been strangled by an ex-partner beforehand, the authorities categorised her death as a suicide and closed the case.

> Wanting a new legal identity that she could not obtain in Chiapas (where the required legal initiative is currently stalled in the State Congress), Itzayana López Hernández, a young trans [woman], traveled to Mexico City to start changing her [legal identity] paperwork and look for a job opportunity - but she found only death there.
>
> On Sunday 22, the young woman from a rural community in Pijijiapan, located on the coast of the state of Chiapas, was found hanging inside the apartment where she lived in the municipality of Álvarro Obregón in Mexico City.
>
> Although it was initially intended to make the authorities believe that it was a suicide, it was determined that prior to being hanged, Itzayana López Hernández was strangled by her partner, a young man with whom she no longer wanted to continue living.

Despite the evidence suggesting that Itzayana was murdered, a judge closed the case after the coroner ruled that the cause of death was asphixiation by hanging.

> Luz María Hernández Lara, Itzayana's mother, demanded that the authorities reopen the case and avoid corruption, “because My daughter was murdered, she didn't kill herself. ”
>
> After finishing praying, Hernández Lara responded in an interview with Notimex: “I am hurt and disappointed by the Chiapas government and the Civil Registry of Pijijiapan, who did not allow her to recognize her gender, and forced her to emigrate to Mexico City, where she died at the hands of her boyfriend Edwin . ”
>
> She explained that Itzayana was kind, attentive and respectful. ""Her death will weigh on the lack of sensitivity of the Chiapas authorities, weigh on the authorities of Mexico City and the judge who determined that my daughter took her own life, when in fact she was killed by her boyfriend,"" said.
>
> Hernández Lara said it is incredible that the police and investigators of Mexico City at the crime scene heard Edwin apologize to my daughter and near her, but did not notice the beating that he gave her before she died. 
>
> “Her sisters had the courage to travel to Mexico City to identifiy her body and Juanita told me she had taken blows on her face and her whole body. She was the only one that Itzayana told her about things, and on several occasions she told her on the phone that her boyfriend was very jealous and violent, and that he had already threatened to kill her,” she said.

Itzayana was a member of the Diana Sacayán organisation.

A human skull was found with gunshot wounds on 12th May 2016, but was not identified by DNA testing as hers until September 2019.

Her date of death and the identity of her killer (or killers) are unknown.

Dymun was obviously not included on the TDoR 2016 memorial list released in November 2016 by Transgender Europe (TGEU). The date of her identification is used for this report in order that she might be remembered at TDoR 2019 this November.

> ""After more than three years, DNA confirmed the human remains from 2016 Macon homicide case are that of a transgender woman. DNA test results recently obtained by the Bibb County Sheriff’s Office confirmed the match.

> ""Dupree had been missing for two weeks on April 18, 2016, when the Warner Robins Police Department sent out a news release asking for the public’s help finding her. ""The 26-year-old was last seen leaving home, on the north side of Warner Robins, just before midnight April 2. Four days later, Victoria Clark reported her cousin missing. She told police Dupree said she was going to hang out with friends but did not say where or with whom.
>
> ""On May 12, more than a month later, a man mowing grass at a vacant lot on Feagin Road, off Ga. 247, made a gruesome discovery. Amid the kudzu, briers and overgrowth, he found a human skull and called 911. ""At the time, the sheriff’s department could only say that a person had been shot in the head. The sex and race of the victim were not apparent.

> Investigators visited Dupree’s mother, Frankie Allen, and took a cheek swab so that her DNA could be compared to the victim’s remains. In January 2017, DNA from the remains was sent to the Center for Human Identification at the University of North Texas. There, forensic scientists developed a DNA profile and compared it with DNA from Allen that was obtained using the swab.
> 
> “It’s just hard when you don’t know what to think,” Allen told The Telegraph in a May 2018 interview. The last time Allen saw Dupree, she was sitting on her porch reading the mail. The two told each other, “I love you.”
>
> Dupree enjoyed singing gospel music, her mom said. She ate cookies with milk daily, enjoyed drinking Coca-Cola Classic and smoking Newports in the morning.
