Prior to detransitioning Marcelino had lived as a trans woman named Soledad.

> Soledad Fernández, 42, was murdered on Monday, October 7 at night behind Villa del Sol, a closed condominium on the way to the town of Zanja Pyta, a neighbor of Pedro Juan Caballero (Amambay). Soledad, trans who towards the end of his life asked to be renamed Marcelino Soler, was accompanied by Leonardo Miranda De Oliveira when a hooded cis man began to follow them. According to Miranda's later statements, the man told them it was an assault but immediately shot Soledad.

Panambí activist Yren Rotela said the following about the victim:

> “I met Soledad in 2009 because I was a reference for Panambi in Pedro Juan Caballero at that time. That year she was doing a job with the population there. She was also a health promoter, I know she went through many things, ”said Yren and said that since she became involved in evangelism she began to change her gaze towards the collective. In the Church they told her that because she was a [trans woman], ""he lived as he lived."" 
>
> “I understand that when one clings to life looking for some way to survive. Many times, when you live in a context, being trans women, we have no work alternative, we have no studies and we have to endure a lot of violence, discrimination. Doors close on you a lot. She went into depression and sought refuge in spirituality. Which seems very good to me, but that made her return to her socially affected male identity, ”recalls Yren. 
>
> A week ago Yren Rotela and Mariana Sepúlveda celebrated the ruling of the Court of Justice of Luque for the transfemicide of her partner, [Romina Vargas](https://tdor.translivesmatter.info/reports/2017/10/15/romina-vargas-florentin_san-lorenzo-central-paraguay_e5bf40d1).

Lorena Vicente was buried today at 10am. The São Paulo State Department of Public Security reported that the case is investigated by the 92nd DP, but did not give details of the identity of the main suspect, who is on the run.

State Representative Erica Malunguinho (PSOL-SP), an advocate for LGBT rights, participated in the action.
>
> According to history teacher Severino Honorato, Lorena was a dedicated and caring student. “She attended the school soiree, liked to hug the teachers and listened to our advice. We lost our Lorraine, who just wanted to be happy, ”he says.
>
> On November 8, 2017, Lorena's brother Petherson Roberto dos Santos, 24, was beaten to death while trying to defend her from the threats of 18-year-old Luiz Carlos Mariano. The crime took place in a square in Jardim São Luís, where the [siblings] had sat on a bench to use public wifi.
> 
> At the time, police considered that the crime was motivated by prejudice against Lorena. According to the Public Security Bureau (SSP) the perpetrator was arrested.

Her body was then thrown from a vehicle and dumped in front of a nightclub.

> Yesterday friends and family buried the remains of Anahy Rivas, a transsexual woman who was killed early Saturday morning and her body abandoned in front of a nightclub [named Kairos] on Bulevar Los Héroes in San Salvador.
>
> One of Anahy's friends reported yesterday during the funeral that men in a van arrived alongside where the victim was (by the Benjamin Bloom hospital) and the occupants grabbed her by force and drove off.
>
> ""The men did not manage to get her fully into the vehicle when it began to move so that her legs dragged along the ground. She was held that for a journey of almost five kilometers,"" said the friend.
>
> While in the vehicle she was suffocated with her own hair band. When she appeared to be dead, her kidnappers threw her on the pavement.

In December 2019 Juan Carlos Hernández Vásquez, 40, was arrested for her murder and released on bail. In January 2020 a second arrest warrant was issued.

> A video surveillance system allowed investigators to locate the vehicle of the accused. With the information that the system offered the authorities and the tracking of his cell phone, the authorities followed up the suspect until he was arrested early Wednesday when he was just leaving his home, in the El Carmen canton, in the Escalón neighborhood, to the west of San Salvador.
>
> The accused, although he has a criminal record against him, said the prosecutor of the case, are not for felonies.
>
> The only thing that the authorities have not yet established is the motive of the murderer of taking Anahí's life. ""We can not establish a possible mobile because we do not have a witness, you can not know if the victim and the accused was already known, all that will be part of the investigation,"" explained the prosecutor.
>
> “That is a hate crime that can be reflected by being a person of different preferences. We want justice, ”a leader of the guild of transsexuals, the authorities and especially the National Civil Police and the Attorney General's Office of the Republic claimed.

The initial hearing in the trial of Vásquez took place in March 2021. In February 2022 he was acquitted due to lack of evidence.

Edu,18,,,,30-Oct-2019,,,,Llíria,Valencia,Spain,39.625829,-0.59611,suicide,suicide,"Edu took her own life, apparently after suffering harassment and bullying over an extended period.

> The Civil Guard and the Court of Instruction No. 3 of Llíria are investigating whether harassment and teasing have been the trigger for a young transsexual from Llíria to take her own life last Wednesday afternoon. The agents of the Judicial Police team of the capital of the Camp de Túria have already begun the procedures to cite friends, fellow students and relatives as witnesses, to investigate to what extent [transphobia] in her immediate surroundings could have been a trigger in her decision to take her own life.
>
> The young woman, who had been in treatment for some time and had already taken the first steps to face the change of sex after turning 18, took her own life on Tuesday, after being alone at the home of a friend in Llíria with whom she was spending the afternoon.
>
> Hours after her death, many people expressed their solidarity with the girl and her family in social networks - mainly WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram - and criticized the mockery that the young woman had been subjected to.
>
> In fact, Levante-EMV has been able to verify the succession of insults, teasing and criticism that the young woman had been enduring for months every time she posted videos and photographs on one of her social network accounts doing what she liked most: playing songs of her favorite artists. The young woman was a great follower of the talent show La Voz.
>
> Once these suspicions of harassment have been confirmed, the judge and the Civil Guard will seek testimonies, especially from close friends, to be able to confirm if that pressure acted as a trigger to convince her to end her life, something she did while her friend was absent for a few minutes.
>
> It will also be investigated if it is true that she suffered aggressions from relatives in her home environment, and if so whether they were prompted by her decision to [live as herself].
>
> The Civil Guard will also track comments on the social networks of the young woman, mainly on Facebook and Instagram, in which she received insults and mockery regarding her transsexuality. Some of those comments date back more than a year, which shows that he had been suffering from this situation for a long time.

If the agents manage to prove the relationship between harassment and death, the case could end up being instructed as a hate crime.
