Marisol Chacon Vilcacuri,37,,,,6-Dec-2019,,Verona,Veneto,Italy,45.3987982,10.9270831,uncategorised,run over,"Marisol was run over on the A4 motorway between Verona Sud and Verona Est in Italy on the night of Friday 6th December 2019. The driver failed to stop.

> Tragedy in the night between Friday and Saturday, around 4am, on the A4. A 37-year-old Peruvian [trans woman] was mortally wounded by a car on the road towards Venice between the Verona Sud and Verona Est tollbooths, on the fast lane.
>
> The dynamics of the accident is still being examined by the Traffic Police, who intervened on the spot. Also present were the 118 health workers, who intervened with an ambulance, who could only ascertain the death.
>
> The [trans woman], in all probability [a sex worker], died as a result of a serious skull injury: she did not have [identity] documents with her. It is still unclear whether the victim crossed the highway on foot or whether she was dropped off by a car. The driver of the car which hit the trans [woman], did not stop at the scene.

The police identifed the driver who allegedly killed her, a Swiss driver who said he didn't realise he had hit a person and therefore hadn't stopped to ask for help.

If or why Marisol attempted to cross the highway or how she got there remains a mystery. The police are not ruling out the possibility that her body might have been dumped on the road already dead or injured by a third party or that she might have been fleeing from someone who was threatening her and had possibly driven her there.

Italy is one of the countries with the highest number of trans women killed in Europe.

Her skeletal remains were found on 7th December.

> VANCOUVER, Wash. (KATU) – Police arrested a 25-year-old accused of murdering a transgender teenager who has been missing since June.
>
> Investigators said they believe 18-year-old Nikki Kuhnhausen was killed after revealing to the suspect, David Bogdanov, that she was [assigned male at birth].
>
> On December 7, someone found Nikki's remains while collecting bear grass on Larch Mountain in a remote part of northeast Clark County. Detectives say Bogdanov had allegedly been talking with Kuhnhausen on Snapchat and planned to meet on June 6, when she was last seen alive. Authorities say cell phone records for that day show Bogdanov's cell phone was in the same remote area where her body was found.
>
> “We suspect that there was probably some interaction where - and by his own admission - that he determined that, somehow found out during conversation that she was transgender and he stated that he - that was offensive to his culture and he asked her to get out of his van,” said Lieutenant Tom Ryan of the Vancouver Police Dept. Major Crimes Unit.
>
> During an interview with detectives, Bogdonov said he and Nikki had been together in early June, they ""had a conflict"" and he asked Nikki to get out of his van. Bogdonov told them that Nikki walked away and he never saw her after that.

Nikki was from Vancouver in nearby Washington State. She was 17 at the time she disappeared, but by the time her body was found she would have been 18. The date she died has not been confirmed, but cell phone records on the day of her disappearance put her alleged killer in the area where her body was later found.

David Bogdanov, 25, was arrested on suspicion of murder.
 
> Investigators said they believe Bogdanov met Kuhnhausen the morning she disappeared, killed her, and may have driven his white van - or one like it - up to Larch Mountain.
>
> ""The cause of death is always found by the medical examiner's office. There was some evidence that indicates at least the potential of some strangulation involved,"" Lt. Ryan said.
>
> Bogdanov is expected to make his first appearance on second-degree murder charges Wednesday morning at the Clark County courthouse.

On 27th August 2021 Bogdanov was convicted of second degree murder and malicious harassment. Two weeks later on 9th September he was sentenced to 20 years in jail.

> A jury in Washington state found David Bogdanov, 27, guilty on Friday of killing transgender 17-year-old Nikki Kuhnhausen in 2019. The pair had connected on Snapchat before meeting up but Bogdanov flew into a rage after discovering she was transgender during a sexual encounter in the back of his car. He strangled her with the cord of a cellphone charger; her body was discovered six months later in forestland. Bogdanov claimed he acted in self-defense because Kuhnhausen reached for his gun during a struggle, but the jury didn’t buy his version of events. Kuhnhausen’s death led to the passage of the Nikki Kuhnhausen Act in Washington, which outlaws use of the so-called “panic defense” in LGBTQ+ homicides. Bogdanov was convicted of second-degree murder and malicious harassment, which is a hate crime in Washington.

>
> Military Police and technical expertise had reported, after the body was found, that there was a possible back injury, but it was not confirmed by the necroscopic examination, which pointed to the cause of death by asphyxiation.
>
> The delegate also reported that the man has no record with the police. He was found in a rural area in the Marilia region and was attempting suicide, but was prevented by the police.
>
> The victim was killed in the hotel and then the suspect took the body to the farm property by the highway.

She was the founder of a transgender women's housing project in her neighborhood.

> Residents of the Urlândia neighborhood, in the southern Santa Maria region, and the LGBTQ + community are disgusted by the death of Veronica Oliveira, 40 , murdered in the early hours of Thursday on Avenida Borges de Medeiros [and Avenida Presidente Vargas] in the Nossa Senhora de Fátima neighborhood. In social networks, those who met Veronica or her work, expressed regretting the crime and remembering her life.

> According to the report, Veronica's colleagues who were at the scene said that a man arrived by car and offered them $50 to make a program [have sex] with him. After they refused, the man called Veronica, who was among the group, and when she approached the vehicle he stabbed her.

> Veronica was the founder of a transgender women's housing project in the neighborhood. Veronica Alojamento was created 13 years ago and is considered a reference in Santa Maria and the state, being the only one in the city. There, she welcomed transgender women who are often expelled from home by their family and come from various locations across the country. Today about 20 girls live in the accommodation.
>
> Marquita Quevedo, founder of the NGO Equality and friend of Veronica, says that the victim's friends and family are outraged by the violent death:
>
> ""It was another big loss for the trans movement. A pitiful loss. Today we live in fear of leaving home. Every time one of us leaves home, he doesn't know if he's coming back. The climate has long been insecure in the city, especially for night workers. People find themselves entitled to kill a woman at night just because they don't accept to do a program. This is very revolting"".
>
> Marquita recalls that Veronica was known by the affectionate nickname of Mãe Loira [""Blonde Mother""], as she welcomed and took care of all of the transsexual girls in the accommodation. 

Veronica was the third trans person to be murdered in Santa Maria in 2019, the others being [Carolline Dias](https://tdor.translivesmatter.info/reports/2019/09/07/carolline-dias_santa-maria-rio-grande-do-sul-brazil_f837ce95) and [Nemer da Silva Rodrigues](https://tdor.translivesmatter.info/reports/2019/09/07/nemer-da-silva-rodrigues_santa-maria-rio-grande-do-sul-brazil_8130ccdd) on 7th September. After the previous two murders, Veronica had participated in a protest calling for justice and an end to homophobia.

Two days after the murder Gabriel Zanella, 28, was arrested by police and reportedly confessed to killing Veronica.

C.,USA,38.911125,-77.0390165,uncategorised,not reported,"Alice was found unresponsive on the street by police officers. She was revived using CPR and rushed to hospital, but died after admission.

The cause of her death has not been reported. The police report says she was found “not breathing and unconscious and possibly under the influence of an unknown substance.”

> When Alice Carter died Wednesday after collapsing on a Northwest Washington street, there was no immediate outcry.
>
> She had slept on 17th Street north of Q Street for at least 15 years, an advocate said, a transgender woman struggling with addiction and mental-health issues. She recently secured housing through an assistance program, but it wasn’t enough to save her after a life led on the margins.
>
> The Rev. Ben Roberts, director of social justice at Foundry United Methodist Church near Dupont Circle, where Carter worshipped, said her death showed that those who work to help the homeless “fail as often as we succeed.”
>
> “When we lose Alice, we lose one of our very vocal connections to suffering in the community,” he said. “She’s just one more missing voice.”
> 
> Carter, 35, was one of at least 117 homeless people to die in the District so far this year, according to city records. Advocates for the homeless said their numbers showed deaths this year reached a five-year high.
>
> Organizations that support the homeless joined Thursday for an annual vigil, followed by a downtown march through evening traffic while carrying an empty coffin. They urged city leaders to increase spending on affordable housing and warned of the Trump administration’s “dehumanizing” rhetoric on homelessness.

Alice had been homeless for at least 15 years and was well known in the area. She had originally become homeless as a result of coming out as trans.

> Known for years as Baby Alice, Carter’s friendly and cheerful disposition despite her struggle with homelessness and substance abuse made her a popular figure on 17th Street among those who lived there and those who visited or worked at the restaurants and bars, including two gay bars and the gay-friendly Annie’s Paramount Steakhouse, that line the bustling street.
>
> “Last night the gay heavens welcomed another angel,” said gay bartender Dito Sevilla who lives and works on 17th Street, in a posting on Facebook. “17th Street’s longtime resident singing, dancing, rapping, demi-monde, known for years as ‘baby’ Alice didn’t make it,” Sevilla wrote.
>
> “A more harmless and innocent soul has never shared our streets; she’ll be missed terribly,” Sevilla wrote in his post. “Alice loved wearing pink, composing poetry and of course McDonald’s strawberry milkshakes.”
>
> Sevilla said he and many others who live and work in the neighborhood helped Carter by giving her money. Those who knew her said she often held out a cup asking for help.
>
> David Perruzza, former general manager of the 17th Street gay bar JR’s and current owner of the 18th Street gay bars Pitchers and League of Her Own in Adams Morgan, said Alice Carter also hung out on 18th Street outside the McDonald’s in the Adams Morgan neighborhood.
>
> “A lot of you knew her as the transgender homeless girl on 17th and 18th streets,” Perruzza said in his own Facebook post. “Not many know that she was kicked out of her house cause she was transgender,” he said. “Be kind to people. Everyone has a story. People just don’t become homeless,” Perruzza wrote. “Consider donating to an LGBTQ+ homeless shelter in her memory.”  
>
> Ruby Corado, founder and executive director of the D.C. LGBT community services center Casa Ruby, said Carter was an occasional client of Casa Ruby. Corado said Carter had an addiction problem and mental health issues that Corado and others tried to persuade her to take steps to address.
>
> “She was a loving, beautiful soul,” said Corado. “I don’t know too much about her. All I know is when we did outreach I would bring her in and she would take showers, eat, she got clothes, and then eventually she would go back out,” Corado said.
