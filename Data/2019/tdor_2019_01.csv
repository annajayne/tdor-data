> 
> CW Suicide and Transphobia
> 
> I first met Danielle, in a midge infested Scottish field where they were fighting against the industrial destruction of the environment for capitalist gains. She was full of passion and fire, we had a wonderful hike running recon that I'll never forget, A few days later we spent the day lay down, locked on, talking about The Culture series. We spent a night in the cells together for that and what a night. We spent it discussing and arguing politics, science fiction and boardgames. She spoke against the atrocities of this world with an erudite, compassionate voice and changed fundamentally who I am and how I approached the revolution.
> 
> She taught me to listen, to understand and put mutual aid and solidarity with the oppressed at the core of my politics. I'm sure on her travels she planted many such seeds and made the world a better place.
> 
> Unfortunately the world is not always a better place and when it came to transitioning she was hit with an uphill struggle. In the words of her close friend Alice:
> 
> “In a large part, it was transphobia that meant she could no longer face life. 
> It was having her gender questioned and doubted and fetishised and mocked in popular culture, and most painfully of all, amongst those that pre TERF wars, (TERF is someone who is anti trans people, but claim to come from a progressive, feminist, perspective) she would have thought were on the same side as her, as an Anarchist. ... She is not with us because the world is transphobic. When we argue with those who use language that insults, minimises, fetishises or stigmatises trans people its not just an abstract political theoretical debate. These things matter. Real people suffer. Their lives are made unliveable. And we lose dear people from the world, and from progressive political movements.”
> 
> Those who knew her will mourn her passing with love and fury in their hearts.
>
> Please take time to reflect on those around you, touch base with your mates and hug your comrades. Suicide can sometimes happen in a moment of passion but often it builds up over time, the depression permeating every aspect of your life until you feel unable to carry on. If your mate's sharing dark memes, check in on them, let them know you love 'em. Give your transitioning pals a hug and tell them they are valid and worthy.

Martin Saberi, 53, has been charged with her murder.

> Connor Turner, one of Amy's friends, said the 51-year-old was a 'hero' in the local LGBT community.
> 
> He added: ""She didn't have a selfish bone in her body. She helped me through some difficult times when I was younger.
> 
> ""I knew her from when I was 15-years-old. I ended up on the streets for a bit. She found me outside a local shopping market and offered to cook me tea.
> 
> ""Our friendship blossomed, she taught me how to love myself and care for myself. At the time I was coming out as bisexual.
> 
> ""I was absolutely devastated when I heard about her death. I'm heartbroken.""

> Martin Saberi, 55, initially pleaded not guilty to Griffiths’ murder after she was found dead in her flat in Worcester, England, on 14 January, 2019.
>
> He entered a guilty plea on Monday (15 February) just before the murder trial was due to begin in Worcester Crown Court, according to Worcester News.
>
> The trial was due to begin at 10am, but technical issues pushed it back by four hours as court staff struggled to get a video link to work.
>
> An alternative method was eventually found, which allowed Saberi to enter his guilty plea. As a result, the trial was called off as a jury was no longer needed.

On 11th March 2021 Saberi was jailed for life for her murder at Worcester Crown Court. He was also sentenced to life for the butal stabbing of a woman in London just two days earlier. Although she survived, Amy was not so lucky.

Reportedly she threw herself from a bridge after being cornered by pimps who were threatening her.

"Quelly da Silva (""Jeninha"")",35,,2019_01_21_Kelly-da-Silva.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2294409023927226&set=a.515789651789181&type=3&theater,21-Jan-2019,"tgeu/21-Jan-2019/Quelly da Silva ""Jeninha""",Campinas,São Paulo,Brazil,-22.90556,-47.06083,violence,stabbed,"Quelly was stabbed to death with a shard of glass by a man who found her alone in her family's bar. He then ripped out her heart and took it back to his home.
 
Police found her body with an image of a saint placed on it and her chest cut open. Caio Santos de Oliveira, 20, was arrested and confessed to killing her. Police found Quelly's heart wrapped in a cloth in a cupboard in his home.

> Her murderer, Caio Santos de Oliveira, had found her alone at the property on the night of the crime. According to neighbors of the bar, he ""was prowling the neighborhood speaking that it had to kill someone not to die"". 
> 
> The killer used shards of glass to kill the trans woman and remove her heart. The organ was found wrapped in a cloth in a wardrobe at the home of the killer, who also stole $250 and electronic devices from the victim, examinations pointed out that he was not under the influence of narcotics or alcohol.
> 
> After killing and plucking the heart of the transvestite using a glass bottle, the killer placed an image of Our Lady Aparecida on the victim's chest, so that the saint's crown was next to the left arm of the victim.

The case was registered as a ""simple homicide and theft"", but it was plainly anything but.

> Yesterday a guy killed a trans woman, plucked and stored her heart and left a Saint on the dead body, here in Campinas, 30 min from my house. The murderer confirmed, smiling and saying, ""He was a demon, I ripped his heart out.This is it. It was not my acquaintance.I knew him at midnight.""
> 
> This happened yesterday. There is exactly one week the Minister of Women, Family and Human Rights, Damares Alves, said in a video made by her that gays want to ban the Bible from Brazil. A few days before, she also said that a boy wears blue and a girl wears pink, or some other dizziness like that, and I do not even need to remind her of her and her team's efforts to end the ""gender ideology.""
> 
> In an interview with TV Câmara in November 2010, the current president, Bolsonaro, said that ""a choir"" would make the children stop ""getting like that, kind of gay."" In an interview with Playboy magazine in 2011, the president said he would be unable to love a homosexual son. In fact, he said, ""I'd rather have my son die in an accident than show up with a mustache around. He's going to die for me.""
> 
> The only thing that changes from yesterday to today, at least is what it seems to me, is that for those who are LGBT + the fear grows and walking in the street is gradually becoming a terrifying thing. And even more frightening is having to live with people who can not relate any of this to the attitudes of the current government and its staff, or who think that the corruption and communism or threat of the PT making Brazil a Venezuela are more relevant than than people being brutally killed. And by people, yes, it means LGBT +, blacks, women and other minorities. We are also people, not demons that need to be killed, our hearts torn out and a saint placed on top of our body.

There is a further twist to this story, as Quelly was herself allegedly responsible for killing a 17 year old trans girl named Pérola 10 years earlier in January 2009 (see https://tdor.translivesmatter.info/reports/2009/01/31/perola_belem-para-brazil_77ff6e1b). According to her brother, the motive was jealousy.

> In fact the same [Jeninha/Quelly da Silva] lived 4 years in a friend's house and went on the run ... the msm used the name of Jheninha and (Quelly) on social networks ... which tbm left the run of her hometown in Belém from because she took the life of a 17 year old trans girl with multiple stab wounds and nothing was done about it.
> 
> Witnesses including the victim's cousin saw the stabbing and in the desperation to rescue the victim the murderer managed to run away. She was picked up later but was released....Pérola was a friend of this murderous trans woman in Campinas and gave a home and food to her own assassin. If you lived in the neighborhood, you would know the whole story.

In October 2019 Quelly's killer was acquitted following a diagnosis of schizoprenia.

> The Justice of Campinas (SP) ordered the hospitalization in psychiatric hospital for two years and criminally acquitted the 20-year-old who killed the [trans woman] Kelly, in Campinas (SP). The crime occurred on January 21 and the victim's body was found with an open chest and a saint on it.
>
> The young man, named Caio Santos de Oliveira, was diagnosed by a psychiatric doctor as having schizophrenia. At the time of the crime, Oliveira stated that he had torn the victim's heart out because she ""was a demon"".
>
> The defendant was charged with misdemeanor for misdemeanor motives and cruel employment. During the process, the Public Prosecution Service (MP) requested Oliveira's acquittal, with a minimum stay of three years while the defense requested the acquittal and outpatient treatment.
>
> In the ruling of 23 August, Judge Jose Fernando Steinberg ruled that Oliveira is unputable and opted for hospitalization for two years, as suggested by the expert doctor who diagnosed schizophrenia.

After she was found unconscious José Gustavo Gareca was detained and charged with attempted aggravated homicide for mediating gender violence.

> By cross-referencing reports, it was possible to reconstruct that Antonella Mirna left the Caribbean bowling before 5 o'clock in the morning of Sunday 21 October. It is believed that he was looking for his motorcycle when she was attacked. They found her between 6 and 7 in the morning, in the same block of the bowling alley, unconscious, with blows to the head and without her underwear. It was not the first time she had been attacked by violence because of prejudices towards her gender identity.
> 
> According to Mirna Antonella's sister Gareca was known as a street vendor selling bread. And it is known that he served a sentence for having cut his neighbor's throat. The same day he attacked Antonella, he attacked another girl in the same city. Like Antonella Mirna, hit her in the head, although in this case the victim was helped by a young passer-by.
