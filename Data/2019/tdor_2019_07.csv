She had multiple stab wounds and had last been seen alive on Sunday evening.

An autopsy suggested that she had been killed about 36 hours before her body was found.

> Lucía Barrera was a 37-year-old trans activist of the LGBTIQ + collective in Paraná in the province of Entre Ríos. This Thursday, July 18, her body was found with multiple stab wounds inside her home [on calle Ameghino 59] in the city.
>
> Lucia - known as La Loba - lived alone in the house on calle Ameghino 59, near the municipal cemetery of Paraná, a few blocks from the center of the capital of Entre Ríos. Her friends said she had little work, and many unmet needs due to lack of opportunities.
> 
> La Loba (""The Wolf"") shared her life with friends and colleagues of the LGBITQ+ collective. She was able to collaborate with a popular soup kitchen in the Puerto Sánchez neighborhood, several times a week, until she became a beneficiary of the program Hacemos Futuro de Anses. Those who knew her say that she only changed her ID to update the information she had to present to the agency. There she appears as Lucía Barrera, although for her close friends she was and will always be La Loba, or Lucía Torres Mansilla, the author of a book of poetry: Rota.

> Nora Aracil, Lucia's friend, also spoke with Presentes: “La Loba was a big hearted girl, someone who took care of her parents and her siblings. Like all trans people, she had little work and few resources. She was always very supportive.”
>
> Nora is one of those responsible for the Pedro Lemebel Library, which operates in the city's El Sol neighborhood. There La Loba participated in a literary workshop. “She always wrote and that is the thing I want to remember. She always loved to write. On the social networks she published haikus - a poetic genre of Japanese origin. I wrote poetry and a while ago she was the only one who went, every time, to the poetry workshop run by Marita Balla. She was the one who helped her to publish her first book: Rota, from the Caballo Verde publishing house, at the end of 2017. La Loba was working on her second title: Descocida.

**Alone**
<pre>She walks, 
alone,
broken, 
departure,
invisible. 
With pieces of silk, 
paper, 
pain.

She wants [to be] everyone to everyone, 
and no-one. 
And broken follow, 
slowly,
crying,
dying 
With nobody.</pre>

In August 2019 a 16 year old teenager was arrested and charged in connection with the crime after being implicated by forensic evidence.

> Lucia may have been killed by that young man, a minor, as excluded and stigmatized as she. This young man's life is also pierced by vulnerability, as is the life of the wolf. They were similar contexts: discrimination, poverty, exclusion, violence. It is necessary to look carefully to be able to distinguish these tensions and segregations in people's lives: Lucia was poor, she was a prostitute, she was trans, she was a poet; The alleged transfemicide had no resources, no restraint, and was experiencing a context of violence.
>
> La Loba is symbol and fight. We speak of it to turn on the light of that which cannot remain in the dark. Her murder, her transfemicide, is a sign that forces us to think about living conditions, the possibilities of reparation, justice and punishment. But fundamentally it places us again as observers of the role of the State, which must be guarantor so that there is no impunity, so that public policies contribute to eradicating not only the extreme forms of violence, but also the structural conditions that sustain them.

In April 2021 her alleged kiler took his own life.

> A commotion was experienced in the hours of yesterday's siesta in the San Agustín neighborhood of Paraná. A teenager died and the investigations carried out at the scene determined that it was a suicide. It was the young man who was charged with the murder of Lucía Torres Mansilla, the trans woman who received 20 stab wounds in her home on rua Ameghino 59 in Paraná.
>
> This is a case surrounded by tragedies wherever you look at it: a trans woman, who suffered discrimination and pain due to her gender, and then was viciously murdered. An adolescent, little more than a child, with a life marked by injustices and exclusions, and with a bond with an adult person. Now, when the case was about to be referred to trial, with the discussion about whether it was a simple homicide or a transfemicide, the case is closed by an end that few or no one will find an explanation for. Yesterday, when he died, the boy was 17 years old; In other words, when La Loba's murder occurred (in mid-July 2019), he had just turned 16. For a month he was not an unimpeachable minor.

> ""Religion is an absurd burden and leads to this. These are the consequences, that a 24-year-old person, who did not owe or fear it, ended up this way and the truth is not fair. Hopefully the Prosecutor's Office can clarify the crime as soon as possible, as it has done with others, ""he said.

> 
> ""We are worried because it just happens in a season that certain rights have been accessed, that there has been some openness and that, in addition, there have been very strong manifestations of hate, by parts of certain groups,"" he emphasized.

An autopsy revealed she had suffered an intracranial hemorrhage caused by the mixture of oils injected into her chest.

> [deadname] Rivas Martínez, 25 years old, a [trans woman] who identified herself as Sasha María died after an aesthetic treatment of breast enlargement with oil. 
>
> Sasha, who was doing the interventions to increase the size of the bust apparently went to an aesthetic center where in five sessions they would guarantee a considerable increase in size. 
>
> Last Saturday, July 27, the third of the interventions was carried out. 
>
> A transsexual woman, identified as Sasha María (25), died last weekend at the José María Vargas hospital in Caracas as a result of an intracranial hemorrhage caused by a mixture of oils.
>
> Sasha was admitted to the hospital after feeling strong discomfort in the body, after receiving the third injection of oil that was part of a treatment to increase the size of her breasts.
> 
> Sasha María, who in her identity document appeared under the name of [deadname] Rivas Martínez, said treatment was carried out in a clandestine ""aesthetic center"" in Caracas. The authorities reported that they are investigating where the premises are and who the owners are in order to punish those responsible.
>
> The young woman was an agronomist, a native of Ciudad Bolívar. She had emigrated to Caracas, apparently due to differences with her relatives, and resided in the town of Carapita, Antímano.
>
> More and more people are undergoing aesthetic treatments to change aspects of their body, especially increasing breasts and / or buttocks. However, those who do not have the economic means to pay for expensive treatments, resort to much more dangerous “solutions”, such as the use of oils without [medical] certification, reaching the extreme of using even olive oil, motor oil and glue. 
>
> In 2012, the Government of Venezuela banned silicone injections because of its health risk, however, according to figures from the Venezuelan Society of Aesthetic and Maxillofacial Plastic Reconstructive Surgery (Svcprem), 30% of Venezuelan women between 18 and 50 years in 2014 silicone injections were placed in the buttocks. The data on the use of “unconventional” treatments are not recorded in the statistics.
