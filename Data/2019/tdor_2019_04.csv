Her remains were found following a police raid on his apartment after Nika's mother reported her missing. Dr Mikhail Tikhonov, 27, was arrested.

Note that [one Russian language report](https://kursktv.ru/14400) disputes the reliability of parts of the narrative above, suggesting that ""Tikhonov"" was possibly someone previously named Arthur, who had issues with mental health, and that the victim had known for some time.

Initial reports incorrectly named Nika as ""Nina"". Her VK profile is https://vk.com/id452289448.

Among the dead was a 1 year old boy named Santiago.

Becky owned the ""nearby La Esquina del Chacal"" bar (a venue popular with LGBT+ folks in the area) and it appears that she was the target of the attack. The motive may have been related to a protection racket by a local cartel.

> The massacre in Veracruz of 13 people, initially, increased on Saturday the tension in that Mexican state, one of the ones that has suffered the greatest escalation of violence in the country for being the center of dispute of drug cartels, on the eve of the visit of the agent Andrés Manuel López Obrador.
> 
> The death toll rose to 14 today after a man died in the hospital to which he was transferred after the attack. Three other people are still being treated for their injuries.
 
> The first investigations of the crime, where seven men, five women and a one-year-old boy were murdered, reveal that the armed group was looking for a transsexual person, who was a manager of a nightclub and who has been in the last few weeks the target of these criminals, who have murdered the owners of such leisure establishments.
> 
> Among the thirteen victims is the owner of the palapa (restaurant) ""Los Potros"", where the massacre took place, and the transsexual ""Becky"", identified as the manager of ""La Esquina del Chacal"".
> 
> Four more people, injured during the attack, are stable in hospitals in the area, where police forces mounted surveillance operations to prevent the criminals from returning.

Among the victims was Santiago, a one-year-old boy whose father was killed. His mother is in hospital fighting for her life after being shot 5 times. He had turned a year old on 17th April and died from a bullet in the carotid artery. His father César Hérnández Barrera was also killed and his mother is critically ill in hospital after being shot 5 times.

Irma Barrera Álvarez, César Hernández Barrera, Santiago Hernández, Hebert Reyes Martínez, Patricia Cabrera Ramos, Alfredo Meugniot Careta, Juan René López Velázquez, Raúl Palacios Vasconcelos, Felicitas Cabrera Gil, Ana María Santos Hernández, Leobardo Salinas Jiménez, Julio César Vázquez López and Julio César González Reyna have so far also been confirmed as having been murdered during the attack.

The authorities have identified the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) as being responsible for the massacre.

> Mexico City.- Federal and state forces identified two alleged drug trafficking leaders as alleged responsible for the killing of thirteen people in southern Veracruz.
> 
> Intelligence forces from different areas, such as the State Civil Force, the Federal Police and the Mexican Army, maintain the search for these two alleged regional leaders of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG).
> 
> This is ""The Lizard"" and / or ""The Jarocho"", supposed leader of the plaza in Minatitlan, as well as ""El Pelón"", supposed to be the second in command of the criminal organization in this same municipality.

> The Prosecutor of Veracruz said that the motive for the attack was extortion in which two alleged leaders of the Jalisco Cartel Nueva Generación (CJNG) were involved. The first investigations pointed to the fact that the alleged perpetrators sought directly ""Becly Ryn"", who would have stopped paying the criminal group.
> 
> Through social networks circulates a photo allegedly of “The Lizard” or “Mataniños”, presumed to be responsible for the massacre, and José Roberto Sánchez, nicknamed “Comandante 80”, who is thought to be in charge of the Jalisco Cartel.
> 
> The latter, the “Comandante 80”, was an agent of the Public Ministry in Acayucan, Veracruz, when Javier Duarte was governor of the state. Today he is the leader of the “El Mencho” cartel.

> The Ecuadorian Federation of LGBT Organizations denounced on Friday, April 26, the alleged murder of a transsexual woman on a road in the province of Guayas, three days after it announced another violent death of a gay man in the city of Cuenca. If confirmed as murder, this would be the third victim of violent death of an LGBTTI person so far in 2019, the Federation said in a statement. The woman was found at dawn on Thursday, April 25, on the Alternative Bridge PAN North bridge in the Durán county, after a call to the Integrated Emergency Service ECU 911. The first inquiries, carried out by the Office of Traffic Investigation, indicate that the death occurred, in the first instance, because of a hit, says the statement of the Federation, which nevertheless considers ""suspicious"" that someone would travel on that road alone.

She had been dead for several days.

Yaritza had moved from Peru to Argentina three years earlier after experiencing systemic discrimination in her birth country.

> She was born on December 6, 1991 in Peru and had lived in Argentina for three years. Her family heard the news last Sunday. Her mother is a housewife and her father a taxi driver. He traveled to Buenos Aires this weekend to identify her body. ""Her mother, her brother Cristian and I are very sad. My daughter was a very calm, good girl who loved little animals. We talked on the phone often, and the last time, she asked her mother, 'If something happens to me, will you take me and take care of my animals?' She said they had threatened her,"" Carlos Alberto told Presentes.
> 
> Yaritza survived through sex work. She lived with two dogs and a cat in a two-room apartment, on the eighth floor of a building in Balvanera. Her neighbors worried because they stopped seeing her and her pets were restless. Friends had a bad feeling: it was not normal for Yaritza to not answer their calls. ""They approached the building and as nobody answered, they and the neighbors decided to call 911. They also communicated with the person who rented the apartment to enter. The Homicide Division entered and found her body. She had been dead a few days without life, ""Marcela Tobaldi, coordinator of the Rosa Naranja, told Presentes.
> 
> Yaritza had approached this organization to ask for advice on the procedures to make the gender change.
> 
> ""We met sometimes,"" recalls Tobaldi. ""She started going to the Defensoría, where I work. Then we got together in La Rosa Naranja and we had some friends around to my house. She was a sweet girl, very loving. She recently called to say that her updated ID had come through. 
>
> This weekend, Tobaldi and Yaritza's friends met with the father of the victim to see how to move forward. ""I want Justice to be done,"" he said. ""At 13 or 14 we already knew who Yaritza was. I accepted her and did not want her to leave. But she wanted to make her life in her own way, that nobody told her anything, that's why she left Peru with a friend. I studied computer science and worked. My daughter finished high school, but there they all discriminated against her. In Peru it is like that,"" says the father.
> 
> For La Rosa Naranja, Tobaldi asks: ""we want the UFEM (Special Prosecutor in Violence against Women and LGBT + people) - which intervened in Diana Sacayán's transvesticide investigation - to be part of this investigation as well"" . There are strong suspicions that the crime was committed by someone who knew her. Her companions believe that she was suffocated and beaten on the head.
> 
> Tobaldi adds: ""The fact that she is a migrant must be highlighted. Justice is not the same for a poor person, trans and migrant as for a trans and middle class Argentinian. It is proven that transgender people suffer double discrimination because they are migrants and the structural and systematic discrimination that transgender people have. They suffer double. Being a transvestite in the city of Buenos Aires means paying a very high price in life and also in the final destination, death. ""
