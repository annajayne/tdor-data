Both had sought asylum in the USA a year earlier seeking refuge from the violence and transphobia in El Salvador.

> Asociación Aspidh Arcoiris Trans, a Salvadoran trans advocacy group, told the Washington Blade that Aurora, who was also known as Camila, had been reported missing at the end of January.
> 
> The group looked for Camila at various hospitals and eventually learned she had been admitted to Rosales National Hospital in San Salvador, the Salvadoran capital, on Jan. 31 with multiple injuries. Camila passed away on Feb. 3.
> 
> She did not deserve to be killed in this way. We knew her. She was a great human being. A humble woman. the pain and the impotence of knowing what happened to her life and that they did not listen to her and that they did not believe her. All she wanted was to live hopefully that her life would change as she hoped.
> 
> Like many more of the LGBTTTI community they were killed. They are killing us. This must stop their homophobia,  transphobia and lesfobia. Jardin De Las Mariposas feels the pain of knowing that a sister was killed we will remember you when you arrived the first time and when you left you rest in peace at Aurora.

LGBT+ organisation Agencia Presentes originally reported her murder:

> LGBTI organization, Presentes, reported police in the capital San Salvador assaulted the first victim. Presentes is still investigating what led to the murder of Camila a 29-year-old sex worker.
> 
> Camila did not return to her house on 30 January and Presentes is working on two hypothesis of what happened.
> 
> One of the hypothesis is that Camila’s fellow sex workers attacked her. But a number of those sex workers told Presentes that they saw police attack Camila and dump her body several kilometers away from where she worked.
> 
> ‘Presentes has asked police for an official response but it has closed the case and has not responded,’ the organization said in a statement.
> 
> Camila’s body was found on Thursday 31 January and was taken to a nearby hospital where she died from her injuries three days later.

In July 2019 three police officers were arrested on suspicion of having participated in deprivation of liberty and aggravated homicide. In March 2020 a judge ruled that they should be sent to trial.

> The agents of the National Civil Police (PNC), Carlos Valentín Rosales Carpio, Jaime Geovany Mendoza Rivas and Luis Alfredo Avelar Sandoval, were sent to trial for the murder with aggravating circumstances of abuse of superiority againstf [deadname] Díaz, known as “ Camila"".
>
> In his decision the 5th judge. of Instruction of San Salvador, said that after analyzing all the evidence, including the opinion of the forensic doctor, it has been determined that it seems likely that the defendants exercised physical violence against “Camila” since she had been the victim of multiple blows.

In July 2020 the three officers were sentenced to 20 years in prision for the crime of aggravated manslaughter.

She was a member of the House of Xtravaganza who appeared in Big Brother Australia and the UK TV show ""There’s Something About Miriam"".

> Shocking new details have surfaced about the mysterious death of transgender reality star Miriam Rivera. Miriam, who appeared on Big Brother Australia in 2004 and British dating show There’s Something About Miriam, died aged 38 in Hermosillo, Mexico on February 5.
>
> Her death wasn’t reported until this week, and Daily Mail Australia can now reveal that family members were threatened if they tried to investigate what happened.
>
> In an exclusive interview from his home in New York, Miriam’s husband Daniel Cuervo said that he suspects she met with a violent end. Mr Cuervo claimed an unknown male had called him when he was trying to arrange Miriam’s funeral and said: ‘Don’t come back to Mexico or we’ll kill you too’. He later found out her body had already been cremated, leaving no opportunity to perform an autopsy, which he found ‘very suspicious’.
>
> Because he feared for his safety, Mr Cuervo wasn’t able to arrange a proper funeral for his wife. Photos have since surfaced on Facebook of a decidedly low-key memorial service.
>
> Mr Cuervo believes his wife’s death may have been ‘passed off’ as a suicide after she refused to accept work as a prostitute for a man who was ‘infatuated’ with her. He recalled the day Miriam died: ‘On the morning of February 5, Miriam called me [in New York] from Mexico, telling me she was feeling sick and vomiting blood, so I told her to go to the hospital.
>
> ‘She called me again before leaving the hospital at 12pm and that was the last time we spoke.’. At 2pm, Miriam was found dead by hanging at her home in Hermosillo. 

In November 2021, an investigative podcast series about the series titled [Harsh Reality](https://variety.com/2021/digital/global/miriam-rivera-wondery-series-1235114091/) was released.

> Podcast studio Wondery has set up “[Harsh Reality](https://variety.com/2021/digital/global/miriam-rivera-wondery-series-1235114091/
),” a six-part investigative series on trans reality TV star Miriam Rivera’s controversial 2004 British reality dating show “There’s Something About Miriam.”
>
> The series aims to unpack the true story of the show, starring Mexican model Rivera, which aired on Sky. Set in a villa in Ibiza, the series followed six men who competed for a cash prize and for the love of Rivera. The show — produced by Remy Blumenfeld’s Brighter Pictures, which later became Remarkable under Endemol Shine U.K. — revealed she was transgender, but only in the final episode.
>
> The series is written by Agnes Borinsky and produced by Eleanor Biggs. Executive producers are Max O’Brien and Morgan M. Page for Novel and George Lavender, Marshall Lewy and Jen Sargent for Wondery. Trace Lysette, best known for her recurring role as Shea on Amazon series “Transparent,” serves as host.
>
> Lysette said: “Like many trans women from the 90s era and before, Miriam was a woman ahead of her time; a diamond in the rough that the world couldn’t appreciate in the way she deserved. I had the pleasure of knowing Miriam through NYC nightlife and the ballroom scene. She was a part of the House of Xtravaganza when I was earning my stripes in the House of Angel in the early 00’s. She was always kind to me and I feel honored to help bring this podcast about her life to the listeners. I hope she can finally be celebrated and appreciated for the pioneer that she was.”

Miriam's IMDB profile is https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1578049.

"Faye (""Morena Black"")",,,2019_02_24_Faye-Morena-Black.jpg,https://twitter.com/PansexualJohnny/status/1100760118709366789,24-Feb-2019,,,Florida,USA,29.065599,-81.884201,suicide,suicide,"Faye reportedly took her own life sometime during the weekend of 23rd/24th February.

Every loss to suicide is an absolute tragedy, and that of Faye is certainly no different. As someone who worked in the adult movie industry her personality and life has probably been subjected to far more scrutiny than most of us, and inevitably for many the person who they remember will be the media personna rather than the real person.

In Faye's case, we can only do what we can to try to balance that out - to give others a chance to remember Faye, the loving wife of Terri, rather than Morena Black, Faye's stage personna.

Faye's wife Terri was kind enough to share the following quote about her:

> ""She knitted and sewed. She liked cooking Puerto Rican food to expand my horizon. We live on a dirt road in a redneck area. EVERYBODY loved us. Except our nearest neighbors, they're religious types but they never bothered us. She said Meow a lot.
> 
> ""She did not like the Leftist mindset of our community and watched me get blocked and banned for not having the good sense to shut up on politics. She supported Trump and absolutely despised Kamala Harris. She filled our home with Dixie and Gadsen flags. A dixie flag is NOT racist.
> 
> ""Her Twitter persona, nor her in person persona towards industry participants, was 180 degrees from the real Faye. She closed her social media,too fake, and finally quit smoking weed. She had just applied for a job at Dollar general because the manager there loved us.""

She died as a result of a blow to the head and was 35-40 years old. Two people were arrested, and their trial began in December 2020.

> The two accused of strangling a trans person (with a male legal identity) on February 24, 2019 in Castellón will sit this coming Friday, December 11, on the bench of the First Section of the Provincial Court of Castellón. A jury will be in charge of judging a man and a woman who are in provisional prison, communicated and without bail for these events since last March 3, after the body of the victim was found on March 1, 2019 on the Camino Caminàs of Castellón.
>
> As highlighted in the brief made public by the Prosecutor's Office , the accused are responsible for a crime of murder, as well as another crime of robbery with violence. According to this qualification, for the male accused the prosecutor is seeking a sentence of  penalty of 25 years in prison for the crime of murder and another five more for the crime of theft typified in article 242.1 of the Penal Code. The representative of the Public Ministry requests a sentence for the accused of 20 years for the murder and 4 more years for the crime of robbery with violence.

Her killers were known to the victim.

> “The defendant and victim coexisted and even contracted life insurance for the amount of 25,000 euros in favor of his spouse, until the defendant was released and the victim learned that he had a romantic relationship with the defendant, with no criminal record computable”, reads the prosecutor's letter, who also specifies that the defendant, after returning with the victim, broke up with her and resumed his relationship with the defendant, which he took every day to a place in the capital of La Plana where she practiced prostitution.
>
> Focusing on the events that ended the life of the victim, who was 49 years old, the prosecutor reports that “knowing the existence of life insurance, the defendants acting by prior and common agreement resolved to end the life of the victim and After picking him up at the municipal shelter with the car, they arrived at the parking lot of a building where the defendant stopped the vehicle and the defendant, suddenly and unexpectedly, took the cable from an iron and placed it around the neck of the victim, beginning to squeeze it hard. Meanwhile, according to the prosecutor, the defendant started the car to avoid being discovered and the victim asked for help and continued driving until the victim stopped moving, stopping the vehicle in an orange grove in the Caminàs road area of Castellón.

In March 2021 the defendants were convicted.

> The jury which has since last Monday deliberated over the murder of a trans woman in Castelló in 2019, has unanimously declared guilty the man and woman accused of the crime. The defendants were a couple when the events occurred and the man had also had a stormy relationship with the victim, Isa.

> 
> The crime scene was considered ""shocking"" by those who had access to the scene. The amount of blood and the violence of the injuries can be indicative that more than one person could have committed the murders.
> 
> Although there is no evidence of homophobic crime, the death of a trans woman in Paturis Park refers to a story that happened more than ten years ago. Between July 2007 and August 2008, 13 homosexuals were killed on the spot. Most of the bodies were found face down, with shots at the nape of the neck, half-naked and with pants down - which is a crime of sexual intolerance.
