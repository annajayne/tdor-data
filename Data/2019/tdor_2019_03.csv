> San José, Mar 7 (elmundo.cr) - The commissioner of LGBTI Affairs of the Presidential House, Luis Salazar, dedicated a few words to the recent murder of a trans woman in Costa Rica.
>
> The victim was María Paula Murillo Reyes, who was murdered on March 5 while working in the sex trade.
>
> ""Trans people walk a highly dangerous path since childhood: expulsion from their homes, school exclusion, sexual exploitation or trade, unemployment, street violence, daily discrimination to put simple examples are risk factors and exclusion that end with a project of life at a young age,"" Salazar added.
>
> For its part, the NGO Transvida asked that the identity of Murillo Reyes be respected, since in some press releases she has been described as a 'man' or they have used their previous name [i.e. deadname] to mention her.
>
> Transvida said that if these actions continue in the media, they will carry out a sit-in in their buildings or take legal measures.

Maria had transitioned 20 years earlier and had alsways been supported by her family. Like many trans women in Latin America, she had to earn her living through the sex rrade.

> Carlos Murillo Reyes, the brother of the victim, spoke with DIARIO EXTRA and explained that the now deceased was born [trans], and 20 years earlier had decided to change gender. Recently she had earned her living as a sex worker.
>
> “She was born under the name [deadname] on September 4, 1983 and was 35 years old. She was a person who did countless things, including selling as a merchant and even an astrologer. She was a great human being, a great sister - because for us she was a woman,” he said.
>
> He added that María Paula always lived alone, but for three weeks had resided in López Mateo de San Sebastián, where her mother's house is located.
>
> “She was always very attentive and loving. She was a person who defended everyone. She was the first to arrive when someone had a problem because she had a very strong character (…) Never in the family did she step aside because of the way she was or because of her [gender]. She was always supported,” he said.

> On the street in the early hours were Claudia Vera and four other sex workers - also trans women of initial S, V, R and J, as confirmed by  witnesses in the area.
> 
> Suddenly a couple entered the scene. A man of Peruvian origin urinated on the lamp post, located a few meters from the hotel Las Vegas, where Claudia and her four companions were. Beside him was a woman with a Venezuelan accent.
> 
> The dawn remained silent until the thin man began to scream. ""Why the fuck are you looking at me, shit goats!"" He exclaimed, according to several witnesses on the block. The woman who accompanied him joined in immediately: ""Maricones! You are never going to be women. Pichulones, I do have a vagina! ""

> The woman, with a motorcycle helmet in her right hand, tried to hit Claudia and her colleagues on the street. After a few minutes of struggle and a brief exchange of blows and shoves, the couple left on a motorcycle, threatening loudly that they would return to kill them.
> 
> Almost an hour after the street brawl at just after 6 in the morning, the threats of the aggressor couple were fulfilled. Four people on two bikes stopped abruptly in front of the Hotel Las Vegas and one of them, without taking off his helmet, shot four bullets at Claudia - hitting here in the arm (near the shoulder), head, back and hip. A fifth bullet hit a passer-by on the leg identified as Jesús Montesinos Álvarez (30).

> Sandy Sussel, trans activist and Claudia's partner, told Presentes that the sit-in that will be held at 5 PM seeks to do justice for Claudia, ""Because when it comes to a trans woman, the police do not investigate, they do not care who kills us and why?""
> 
> Various organizations and activists lament Claudia's death and demand the enactment of laws such as the law against hate crimes that protect the lives of trans people, who find themselves in a situation of total exclusion by the Peruvian State.
> 
> From the Aids Healthcare Foundation (AHF) of Peru they said: ""We regret the violent departure of Claudia Vera, trans fellow activist of Jóvenes Cambiando VIHdas, who contributed a lot to her outstanding work in favor of the community. Our condolences to friends and family. ""
> 
> The organization Sí a vida said: ""Not one more death! The human rights of transgender, gay, lesbian, bisexual and intersex people (TLGBI) are not backed by norms and laws in the country. Today one of our instructors and volunteers was killed by several shots at point-blank range in the public thoroughfare in the district of Independencia.

With all her difficulties and help from other people she did not stop until she did it.

Vittoria,40-50,,,,30-Mar-2019,tgeu/30-Mar-2019/Name Unknown/Roma,,,Rome,Lazio,Italy,41.895728,12.5751975,uncategorised,not reported,"Vittoria's body was discovered in a condominium garden on the afternoon of Saturday 30th March by a resident who saw her feet sticking out of the grass.

> What we do know, however, is that her name was Vittoria, she was Brazilian, she had an unspecified age between 40 and 50 years and that she did not enjoy good health either physically or psychologically. 
> 
> ""Vittoria was not well, either physically or mentally, she seems to have stopped caring and decided to abandon herself to death - Cristina Leo, of the Lazio Trans Coordination, writes on Facebook - I don't know much else, I don't know if it's all the truth, but the loneliness that reigns on those sidewalks at night is destructive for those who find themselves alone against the world in a country that is not their own, in a daily struggle for the survival…""

Her cause of death is unknown, but the circumstances are considered suspicious.

> **Rome, trans dead in the garden. Investigators: ""Murder""**
> 
> Horror in a park at the Prenestino. The body of a trans woman was discovered Saturday afternoon, around 2 pm, in a condominium garden in via Franco Angeli, right at the intersection with Viale Palmiro Togliatti. The macabre discovery was made by a resident who, while walking, had glimpsed the feet of the corpse sticking out of the grass. 
> 
> Terrified, the tenant called 112, signaling the presence of a person on the ground who had perhaps fell ill. When medical staff arrived in the garden with the ambulance, the scene that appeared to them was macabre. A body already in a state of decomposition - thanks to the heat of the day - half-naked and in a supine position, lay in the garden. The body did not have any noticeable cutting wounds or injuries but its state of advanced putrefaction did not make it possible to establish the exact cause of death. The coroner described the time of death to be in a period ranging from eight to twenty-four hours before the body was found.
> 
> Agents of the Prenestino police station and detectives of the homicide section of the Roman mobile squad have interviewed inhabitants of the area all day yesterday so there has been a bustle of people coming and going from the scene : they were questioned to attempt to give a name and a face to the trans woman, who it cannot be ruled out may have died elsewhere and then dumped there by someone.
> 
> A few meters from where the shocking discovery was made, in 1993 the body of Giuseppina Morelli was found, a twenty-seven-year-old sex worker who occasionally worked on Viale Palmiro Togliatti. The girl, who lived in Tor Bella Monaca, had disappeared two months earlier.
