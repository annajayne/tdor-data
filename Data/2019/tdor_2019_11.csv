On August 19, after being stabbed 9 times, she somehow survived spending 12 hours bleeding and alone.

He apparently was with one or two other people whose stories contradict each other and the only thing that was stolen was her ID. They took it to support their story that they had gone their to rob her it but in reality they were with the intention of killing her. That indicates that it was an attack of hate, ” Luisa Lucía Paz, president of ATTTA (Association of Transvestites, Transsexuals and Transgenders of Argentina) told Red Harvest .

She dedicated herself to taking care of sick people and her relatives remember her as a rather introverted person, who had no dramas with the neighbors or environment. Although she was not an activist, she used to participate in training and care talks aimed at the T community.
