Today, as is the day, it is as if I had a void inside,” she says.
>
> Larissa died on the eve of Mother's Day and did not get a chance to realize a surprise she had planned. “Before May, she told me she wanted to take a trip with me. She said we were going to Natal, and showed me the tickets. Two weeks later she asked me if I would think it bad if we didn't go to Christmas. Then she called Rosana and said that this year she would not spend Mother's Day with us because she was preparing a big surprise. For me, when the coffin arrived, it was a big surprise. Later I learned that she wanted to reunite her family to take to the Basilica of Our Lady Aparecida, that she was devoted, ”says Rosângela.
>
> “I feel that a little of me went along with her, I feel very down, I feel that a little of me is dying. Sometimes I'm just feeling like they're throwing acid at me that burns me from the inside.

She had reportedly been distressed at not being able to access hair removal treatment and her mental health needs were not being met by the NHS.

> Alexandra Greenway was 23 years old when she died on 11 May 2019. She became unresponsive after excessive vomiting that night, having potentially ingested a toxic substance. Alexandra was a transgender woman, who experienced mental ill health and was under the care of Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership NHS Trust and her local GP. In the weeks before her death she reported increasing distress relating to a desire for the gender affirming treatment of hair removal.
> 
> Alexandra was from Bristol. She loved literature and enjoyed playing the guitar. Her family say that as a child, she had an inquisitive mind. She could read by the age of three and was regarded as a gifted child at school. She was interested in political controversy and human rights. She chose to study clinical psychology at university, because she was interested in what made people tick.
> 
> Alexandra identified as a transgender woman. She had previously accessed some gender affirming treatment including a surgery in 2017, but her family report she had very difficult experiences with this including poor treatment by NHS staff. Alexandra also had complex mental health needs. Trans people are at disproportionately high risk of mental ill health and suicide.

An inquest held into her death in October 2020 recorded a conclusion of suicide. At it, her mother gave evidence that Alexandra was waiting for NHS talking therapy when she died.

> The mother of a transgender woman found dead at her flat in Bristol has told an inquest that her daughter and other people with mental health issues had died because they are unable to access the talking therapy they needed.
> 
> A month before she apparently took her own life, Alexandra Greenway, 23, was escorted to a psychiatric hospital for her own safety by police after what they believed was a suicide attempt.
> 
> The consultant psychiatrist who spoke to Greenway at the hospital wrote to her GP recommending that she received talking therapy.
> 
> Greenway was relieved at the idea that she was finally going to get the treatment she felt she needed, but by the time she died on 11 May last year, no therapy had been arranged.
> 
> Her mother, Jacqueline Greenway, told Avon coroner’s court: “The fact is people keep dying, and they die because the treatment doesn’t materialise.”

She died at the scene.

Local media reported that she may have died after fleeing from a taxi driver to avoid paying him, but reading between the lines it sounds like she might have been beaten and robbed elseware and either flagged down a cab to escape or been attacked by the taxi driver himself, before running away and entering the building where she died.

An investigation for the crime of culpable homicide was opened by the police. As her body was found with breasts exposed and trousers open it is presumed that she also suffered an attempted sexual assault.

Like so many cases we may never know anything more about her or what really happened, but it's pretty clear that she was a victim of some kind of violence.

> MEXICO.- The transsexual woman who was found dead on May 13 in a building in the Narvarte neighborhood, mayor Benito Juárez died inside the ground floor of the building, after minutes before she ran away from a taxi driver to avoid paying him and even, According to witnesses, the girl asked for help and was running.

Later, in front of one of the apartments of this five-story building, she fell head-on and hit her face. It was then that a neighbor saw her. Once the girl got up, a man opened the door of the building and let her into the ground floor to escape any danger; However, a taxi driver then arrived and alleged that the woman got out without paying him, so he called the police to discuss the situation.

> After several minutes of dialogue between the driver and the officers, they decided to leave. However, the woman was not examined or attended to by medical staff despite having been beaten and remained lying inside the building to recover and rest.

José Matías De la Fuente Guevara,16,,2019_05_23_Jose-Matias.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/ColectivaTransForma/posts/684660451990715,23-May-2019,,Copiapó,Atacama,Chile,-27.36755,-70.33411,suicide,suicide,"Matías died by suicide after suffering constant bullying and transphobia at his school. Staff refused to recognise his gender and in death he was misgendered by the authorities.

> The Movement of Homosexual Integration (Movilh) denounced the suicide of a 16-year-old trans youth in Copiapó, a city in northern Chile. On Thursday, May 23, Matías jumped from the building where he lived. He left a sucide note stating that he had suffered constant bullying at his school, the Sacred Heart Lyceum. To date, the school has not issued a statement.
> 
> Movilh demanded intervention by the Ministry of Education (Mineduc) in the case. In addition, they denounced the fact that the representative of Education, Silvia Álvarez, referred to the deceased in female, although he identified himself as male.
> 
> Matías suffered ""constant bullying because of his identity from other students, as well as some officials from the Sacred Heart Lyceum who rejected his gender expression. They also point out that the high school management did nothing when they knew of the existence of episodes of bullying, ""said Movilh spokesperson Daniela Andrade.

A march and vigil for Matias was held on Tueday 28th May 2019.

> José's mother, Marcela , said her son had begun the social transition at age 13. She tried to create a WhatsApp group with other parents, but left the group after José's death. In the last conversation she had with him, she asked him to change his school, without knowing that the institution was punishing him for being different. The mother accused the teachers and the school inspector of treating José badly, humiliating him after having discovered his trans identity.
>
> ""My son always felt marginalized ... he spent many hours exposed to strange looks, comments and ridicule. As a mother I can say that I do not want to go to that school anymore, I want them to be stained with my son's blood. ""

In January 2020 the school was fined for its part in Matías's death.

> During the afternoon of yesterday the mother of José Matías, a trans adolescent who on May 23, 2019 took his own life after having received constant bullying and harassment by his companions at the Sacred Heart High School in Copíapó, was called to the offices of the Superintendency of Education to learn the results of the investigation carried out by into the institution to the school authorities. 
>
> It was ruled that the high school was responsible for failing to comply with all the regulations relating to the circular on the rights of girls, boys and trans students.
>
> Likewise, they did not implement or publicize the opportunity for students to seek gender recognition, so José Matías was left without any opportunity to develop his gender identity. 
>
> Finally they indicate that the educational establishment was sanctioned with the maximum sanction, which is equivalent to 55 UTM. 

In March 2020 Matías's mother Marcela Guevara published a book she had written to tell her son's story:

> ""My son deserves it, it is a way of paying a great tribute to what his life was, it is my mother's vision, how the experience of losing a child felt after he committed suicide.""

Neighbours called the police after hearing her screaming.

> A trans girl was murdered. It happened in a house on Calle Eliseo Cantón at 100, in the city of San Isidro de Lules. A person was apprehended who had a relationship with the victim.
> 
> According to some witnesses, the couple had an argument and neighbors called the police. When the police entered the house they found the victim without vital signs. She had been strangled.
> 
> The 42 year old alleged partner of the trans girl was arrested. The Public Prosecutor's Office and the Police continue to investigate the case.

Victor Exequiel Natalio Martinez, 42, was arrested for her murder. His sister Ángela said this of him: *""My brother was always a violent person. He had no affection for anyone. Hit even the dogs. It's ugly for all of us and especially for me because he's my brother, but hey ... He has to pay for the crime he committed.""*

According to her relatives, Gala had been forced into sex work by the man who ultimately murdered her.

> “Gala was looking for work but couldn't find it, she was unemployed. She prostituted herself because her partner demanded it to have more money: that was told by the detainee's own sister.
>
> Today trans women continue to be discriminated against and killed; It is ugly that society does nothing to stop this, ”Perea began. The woman broke down in tears when she was asked about the measures of a minimum 1% of trans workforce that were ordered for the employees of some public institutions such as the City Council Deliberative and Justice. “I was very satisfied that they are starting to accept trans people.
>
> My sister will not be able to enjoy it, but I know that this would make her very happy, that everyone can work like anyone else, ""she said through tears.

In October 2021, Victor Ezequiel Martínez, 45, was sentenced to life imprisonment for her murder.

> In an abbreviated trial, Víctor Ezequiel Martínez, 45, was sentenced to life imprisonment for the crime of aggravated homicide and for premediated gender violence (according to art. 80 inc 1 and 11 of the Penal Code) for the murder of Gala Perea, a youn trans woman of 19.
>
> According to her sisters, Gala had been in a relationship with Martínez since she was 15 years old. He lived with his mother and father in Famaillá, on weekends she would travel to Lules and stay a few days at Martínez's place.
>
> ""We never liked him,"" says [redacted] del Valle Perea, Gala's older sister. ""You could see in his face that he was a cold person, he was scary."" More than once we asked her to leave him, to walk away, to find someone else who would not hurt her. ""She was very young and naive,"" she said. He was twice her age.
>
> Her family saw her with bruises and marks on her arms. In fact, [her sister] remembers that Gala once wanted to make a complaint at the Lules Police Station, but they would not take it. “The note was not taken to the police station. As women they sometimes don't give importance to us, and much less to trans women. Justice is there for when they kill you, there they go to pick you up, when it's too late. The State is absent, not only with Gala, but with many girls who have been through the same situation.""

According to the Portland Mercury, Titi was genderfluid: her family knew her as a cisgender gay man named Otis who sometimes dressed in drag - but among friends, Gulley typically presented as a woman, used she/her pronouns, and went by the name Titi.

As she is now deceased, we obviously can’t ask her which pronouns we should use. With the exception of quotes from family members, this page uses her female name and pronouns because that is how she usually presented publicly.

Since the night of Gulley's death, they have found the PPB to be unreceptive to their concerns. Kenya Robinson, Gulley’s mother, told the Mercury she believes some of this indifference has to do with Gulley's identity.
> 
> “You didn’t ask any questions,” said Robinson, referring to the PPB. “You saw a Black man in a tree who was in a homeless camp, and you wrote him off as being a transient homeless, and wrote it off as a suicide.”
> 
> Gulley had been homeless for most of her adult life, and also struggled with mental illness that Robinson said was caused by a difficult birthing process. Gulley was in regular contact with her mother and three siblings, and had been working with the homeless services nonprofit JOIN to try to find housing shortly before she died. Robinson said she had many friends in Portland’s homeless community, and was known by friends and family as a cheerful, helpful, and loving person.
> 
> “He was always wanting to help,” Robinson said. “‘Want me to cook? Want me to do your nails, do your hair, do something for you? Take the trash out?’ That’s just him.”
> 
> Though Gulley faced challenges in life, her family said that as far as they knew, she never mentioned suicide or attempted to harm herself. In fact, the family initially hoped the case was an instance of mistaken identity, and that Gulley was not actually the person found hanging in Rocky Butte Park. They weren’t permitted to view Gulley’s body and confirm it was hers until a week after she died.

Titi's friends do not believe that she died by suicide either.

> Gulley's friends do not believe she died from suicide. In the weeks following her death, many of them contacted her family, claiming that Gulley had been murdered, and was then hung from a tree to make it look like a suicide. They said there were other homeless people had witnessed it, and that someone had a video.
> 
> The Mercury has not independently confirmed any of these rumors. But every time Gulley’s family has attempted to inform PPB about what they have been hearing, they say they have been met with either bureaucratic confusion or cold indifference.
>
> Gulley’s brother, Richard Bryant, used to be a police cadet. He said he isn’t surprised by PPB’s response. “You know they treat a lot of homeless people like they don’t mean nothing to this earth, right?” Bryant said. “So in the homeless community, other people are willing to do hurt to more people, because they know their voices won’t be heard. They’re just homeless.”
> 
> Physical aspects of Gulley’s death also strike her family as suspicious. After PPB returned Gulley's belongings to her family, her sister Crystal noticed that Gulley's clothing was muddy. She said it wasn’t like her sibling to go out in dirty clothing—especially on the day she died.
> 
> “He was with some women [earlier that day] taking pictures,” Crystal said. ""They’d just gotten their faces done. … Everybody that knows my brother knows that if he puts makeup on, he’s trying to be seen.”

Titi was by all accounts a vulnerable individual. She had recently been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, and was living on the streets.

Her death is being treated as a possible suicide.

> Techi's body had been dragged by the waters of the Chili River. The rocks contained it. She was almost naked, apparently the waters ripped off her clothes. An orange polo shirt wrapped around his face. It was impossible to say how long the corpse was submerged in the torrent. A neighbor notified the police of the find. While the body of the victim was removed, radios and virtual channels gave account of their physical features: a man of 45 to 50 years.
>
> The tragedy of Techi hit members of the trans community of Arequipa . She left home on May 26, and three days later, she was a corpse. The investigation considers a possible suicide, but the fact that her body had a polo shirt covering her face awakens the suspicion of this community, so tormented by violence and impunity.
> 
> Do you think it is a hate crime ? Ana Flavia Chávez, a transsexual woman, points out that determining that in Arequipa is difficult, as the law does not ensure a transparent investigation. For the law, only the body of a man was found in the river, there is no way to account for the fact that it was a person belonging to a vulnerable group.
> 
> In life Techi was encouraged to admit her gender identity at an already mature age. Ana Flavia says she started wearing tight clothes and letting her hair grow. This process was interrupted because her clients stopped buying from her. Then she went back to dressing as before while selling merchandise on the Andrés Avelino Cáceres shopping platform. The autopsy conducted on her body indicates that Techi was HIV+.

A 15-year-old teenager is being sought by police.

> A [trans woman] identified as Rosinha do Beco, 63 years old, was murdered in the last Thursday (May 30) in Seabra, in the region of Chapada Diamantina. The victim had her body and house burned. The crime happened around 7am, at Aloísio Rocha Street, in the Artur Alves neighborhood.

> According to the Blog Bom Sucesso Freedom, at the scene of the crime, investigators found in the residence a piece of wood with blood stains. Besides, the walls were stained with blood and the furniture in the house was upended. The perpetrators and motivation of the crime are investigated by the Civil Police.

Rosinha was a street vendor who was well known in the city.

> ""They murdered Rosinha, the oldest [trans woman] in Chapada Diamantina, in Bahia, they killed Rosinha and  set fire to her body. Rosinha was loved by all, fair, good-humored and playful,"" wrote Sayonara Nogueira of the Brazilian Trans Institute of Education (IBTE) on Facebook.

> 
> ""(Rosinha) was no longer suffering from stigma and prejudice because she was a [trans woman], and was seen more like an elderly, good-natured, playful and hard-working woman,"" says the RenospLGBTI publication. ""Her death in a place where crimes of this kind are not common, where one usually does not hear of lgbtphobic crimes, can be read as a reflection of the culture of prejudice that is gaining strength in Brazil.""
