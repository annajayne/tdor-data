> 1. Ms. [Redacted] resides at [Redacted] Somerville, MA.

> 2. On March 8, 1981, she stated to Boston Police Detective Richard Walsh that Paul Cassiani had admitted to her that he had killed a man that the Commonwealth now alleges was [Denise] Pugliese. See the attached Grand Jury Minutes dated March 25, 1981.
>
> 3. When called before the Suffolk Grand Jury to testify as to what she knew, she was represented by counsel, in the person of Mr. Ralph Champa, Esq. of Somerville, MA. At that time she refused to testify, claiming her right against self-incrimination.
>
> 4. On April 21, 1981, the Supreme Judicial Court refused to act on the Commonwealth's Application for Immunity, stating that given the facts presented at the hearing there was insufficient basis to find that the witness had a Fifth Amendment privilege, and therefore, there was no basis upon which to grant an order of immunity.
>
> 5. On Thursday May 21, 1981, [Redacted] appeared before the Grand Jury, without counsel, and again refused to testify. The matter was continued until Monday June 1, 1981, in order to give [Redacted] an opportunity to retain counsel.
>
> 6. On Monday June 1, 1981, [Redacted] again appeared before the Grand Jury and refused to testify. She has been unable to retain an attorney, claiming that she has insufficient funds to do so.
>
> Therefore the Commonwealth moves that this Court appoint counsel for [Redacted] and then schedule a hearing relative to the Commonwealth's motion to order her to testify before the Grand Jury.
>
> Respectfully submitted for the Commonwealth,
>
> John A. Kiernan, Assistant District Attorney [[5]]
