Her killer got back in his car and drove off.

She was the third transgender person killed in Los Angeles since June.

> Deshawnda Bradley, 21, also known as Tata and Deshawnda Sanchez, was shot around 4 a.m. Wednesday, near Wilton Place and 62nd Street, according to the Los Angeles Police Department. Police said they were investigating whether the killing was a hate crime. 
> 
> “We don’t know what happened,” Bradley’s twin sister, Deshawn Bradley, told The Huffington Post on Friday. “There has been so many stories — mistaken identity or robbery gone wrong.”
> 
> The slaying was captured, in part, by a surveillance camera. The video is said to show someone pull up to the house in a vehicle, get out and run to the porch, where Deshawnda Bradley was shot. The person then fled in the vehicle, police said. Police haven’t released the video.

Robert James Spells, 30, was arrested for her murder.

She was believed to have walked 3-4 miles from her parents house in nearby Kings Mill.

A suicide note she had previously written later appeared on her Tumblr blog as a scheduled post. As a result of the note, news of her suicide spread rapidly.

In the note, Leelah said she identified as a transgender female from age 14, when she first became aware of the term, having felt “like a girl trapped in a boy’s body” since she was four.

> Leelah said she subsequently came out online, and turned primarily towards the internet for friendship. She said she attempted to convince her parents that she had to medically transition, but claims she instead received therapy and “biased” counseling from Christian therapists:
> 
> Leelah also describes coming out as gay at age 16, hoping it would be a stepping stone to coming out as transgender at a later date. She wrote that she was instead taken out of school by her parents and cut off from the outside world for five months as her parents denied her access to her laptop, social media and phone.
> 
> She described this as a contributing factor towards her suicide. 
> 
> The main way I will rest in peace is if one day transgender individuals aren’t dealt with the way I was,” her suicide note peruses. “My passing needs to mean something.”
> 
> “My passing needs to be checked in the quantity of transgender individuals who submit suicide … I need somebody to take a gander at that number and say ‘that is f- -ked up’ and fix it.”
> 
> “Fix society,” she argued. “If you don’t mind Signed, “(Leelah) Josh Alcorn.”

> It is nearly 5am and im going to do a sleep-deprived thread on Leelah Alcorn
> Suicide TW for the whole thread. No gory pictures will be shown, period. Suicide note will be shown.
> 
> Remembering our transgender sister Leelah Alcorn who took her own life three years ago today at the age of 17. Her suicide led to a ban on conversion therapy in her hometown of Cincinnati, but how much have we ""fixed society"" since she left us?

In death her mother still refused to acknowledge her daughter's transgender identity.

According to her mother several hours earlier the same people had sprayed a liquid on her daughter's face and tried to burn her.

> The social acceptance of Dilan, as a woman, was reduced to a Facebook profile with the pseudonym Yeimi Andrea. There she organized her outings and also received sexual proposals for money, which came in piles. There she also discharged her sorrows of love. ""The one who made her suffer the most was a good macho man,"" says Paula, a robust woman, one of the aunts-neighbors who knew her the most.
> 
> On that same Facebook, Dilan moved away from the life she created for others, which she hid as he said ""out of respect for her brother and his mother."" Her true identity comes to life in the photos. Yeimi Andrea is extroverted, sexy and appears with a tiny purple mesh dress that reveals pieces of white skin. Curly hair set aside, long eyelashes and red mouth give life to Yeimi. There are dozens of comments in each post, all are from men, who praise and declare, has more than two thousand followers.
> 
> Dilan studied nursing at OTEC José Obrero and finished her practice with grade seven. Last year she worked in a nursing home and since then she was dedicated to the sporadic care of some elderly people in the upper neighborhood. She had to leave her previous job as a result of the constant harassment of a boss and his coworkers. Before, she only had occasional jobs as a guard in a supermarket and a clothing salesman in a mall. As a guard she had to ""dress up"" as a man to ""fit in"", explained his mother.
>
> ""If she did not hide who she was, she could not get a job. She suffered there, she had to cut her hair"", recalls Elvira.

In February 2015 María Inés Norambuena Parra, 52, was arrested in San Antonio for her murder. Allegedly she stabbed Dilan after learning that her partner had had sexual relations with the Dilan. Norambuena reportedly had a police record that included records of theft, violation of the Drug Law, infraction of the Weapons Law, robbery with intimidation, robbery with violence and homicide.
