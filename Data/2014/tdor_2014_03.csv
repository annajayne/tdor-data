> With great sadness, the relatives of [deadname] Martínez Figueroa, recognized in the LGTBI community as Angelina, waited with great pain that yesterday afternoon they could remove [her] corpse from the Legal Medicine morgue, to watch [her] at his mother's house in the neighborhood of August.
> 
> The 18 year old [trans woman] was assassinated Sunday in Canapote night after receiving a bullet in the head. The facts are confused: while his family says it was a stray bullet fired by a policeman who tried to control a fight that caused [her] death, the institution says he still has not determined who shot [her], because the incident occurred in the middle of a fight, that uniformed came to control and ended up being attacked. The case is in the hands of the General Prosecutor's Office, which will be in charge of investigating and determining what actually happened.
> 
> In the event two policemen and three young people were injured. Among the young people is Hamilton Martinez, who is already recovering at home, in the Santa María neighborhood. The young man told El Universal that everything happened when he left a nightclub, accompanied by Angelina and other friends. He explained that while they were taking a taxi, they were in the middle of a fight and ended up being attacked by policemen who believed they were participating in the fight. In the middle of the confusion Angelina was shot. The owner of the club clarified that the problem happened far from his business, in a nearby street, and that Angelina fell in the corner of the House of Justice of Canapote when she was shot.

"Cecilia Báez Barboza (""Caramelito"")",35,,,22-Mar-2014,,"Bahía Blanca, Buenos Aires",Argentina,-38.7210746,-62.3265839,medical,cosmetic filler poisoning,"Cecilia died in hospital of a pulmonary embolism after having a silicone injection in her buttocks.

> On Saturday night,  Cecilia was injecting silicones on her buttocks when she became ill and had to be taken by friends to the José Penna provincial hospital in Bahía Blanca. There she died hours later. ""The cause of death was a pulmonary embolism,"" said Deputy Commissioner Gustavo Ceballos, deputy chief of the third police section. He confirmed that in the place where the practice was taking place, a humble dwelling in the Spurr neighborhood on the outskirts of the city, there was no doctor. The victim, a trans woman, was only there with friends.
> 
> Báez was 35 years old and had arrived from the province of Chaco to settle in Bahía Blanca. A little over two years ago she moved to Viedma, but returned shortly after.
> 
> Carolina Martinez, a member of the Association of Transvestites, Transsexuals and Transgenders of Argentina (ATTA), was not her friend but had a regular deal with her. She attributed the tragedy to the lack of public support in performing such procedures. ""We have to put an end to these illegal practices and the injections of liquid silicone that sooner or later people pay dearly for. The State should take charge of these operations,"" she told Clarín.
> 
> She added that despite the identity law which allows trans people to have their documents in the name they chose, trans people still do not have full and comprehensive access to health coverage. In this case, it transpired that the liquid that Báez had injected was airplane oil and had affected an artery. ""It is a very risky practice because it is placed between the dermis and the epidermis,"" Martinez said. She said that the consequences can include death or amputations. ""There are many more cases than are known,"" she said and explained that in the search to femininise their bodies, many trans people resort to these clandestine practices for economic reasons.
> 
> ""A backstreet operation of that type can cost about 2 thousand pesos, but while carried out with appropriate care, 14 thousand"". Báez, whom in the nightlife of Bahía Blanca they called Caramelito, lived alone and until last night her relatives had not been located. Because of that, her body remained in the judicial morgue.

Cecilia's death was not recorded on the official TDoR 2014 list released by Transgender Europe (TGEU).
