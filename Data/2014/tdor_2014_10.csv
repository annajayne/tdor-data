>
> This week, the California woman posted on Facebook a long suicide note before taking her life. In the note, she explained that pressures of living as a trans woman.
>
> In the note, von Roeder explained that transitioning was too difficult, writing, “I shouldn’t have done it. Not because I’m not trans, but because I didn’t have a fraction of the personal strength to succeed at it, unlike some of the amazing trans people I’ve been privileged to know.”
>
> The note garnered immediate responses from Facebook friends, who pleaded with Kate to call a suicide hotline or respond to their calls. But within four hours of posting the note on Facebook, police confirmed that Kate von Roeder had committed suicide.

Kate was a tech analyst at Riot Games and was a prominent member of the League of Legends community.

Her death became a news sensation because the alleged suspect was a US Marine who was participating in a regular military exercise under the Visiting Forces Agreement.

US Marine Lance Corporal Joseph Scott Pemberton was convicted of her murder and sentenced to 6 to 12 years in prison.

> A US Marine was found guilty of killing a transgender woman in the Philippines on Tuesday and sentenced to six to 12 years in prison, closing a case that has reignited debate about the American military’s presence in its former colony.
> 
> The Olongapo City regional trial court also ordered Lance Corporal Joseph Scott Pemberton to pay more than 4.5 million pesos ($95,350) to the family of Jennifer Laude, who was found dead last year in a hotel outside a former US navy base northwest of Manila. Pemberton had been charged with murder, but was convicted of the lesser offense of homicide, which does not require malicious intent.

In 2018 the documentary ""Call Her Ganda"" was released about her case.

In early September 2020, Pemberton was pardoned by Duterte, the Philippine President. He was deported back to the United States in August 2022.

> On Monday, just days after a Filipina court stunned the world by ordering the early release of former U.S. Marine Lance Cpl. Joseph Scott Pemberton, President Duterte pardoned the convicted killer of transgender woman Jennifer Laude.
>
> The Department of Foreign Affairs and the U.S. Embassy did not immediately respond to questions by the Washington Post on whether the pardon had been requested by the U.S. government.

> **Opinion: This outrageous injustice was undoubtedly facilitated by loser Trump hoping to pander to his right-wing trans hating extremist base during the election year.**

> Following his partying on board his ship the smirking criminal proudly displayed his arrogance in the 2014 mug shot further enraging the LGBT worldwide community. We wanted to believe time would wipe that smirk off his face, but we were wrong.

She had been shot in the head.

> The body of Ashley (nee Tajshon) Sherman was discovered on the east side of Indianapolis on Sunday evening by a police officer who was making a traffic stop in the area. Ashley was a black trans woman who identified as female according to family members, and called herself Ashley according to co-workers. She had been the victim of numerous cases of harassment and abuse, and was a runaway at age 12. Police later updated their reports with the information that Ashley had been shot in the head. Neighbors in the Tudor Park Condominiums report hearing a shot around midnight that evening.
> 
> Initial coverage of Ashley Sherman’s death was complicated by the police and local media mis-gendering her as male after initially identifying her as female, and mis-naming her as her birth name instead of her chosen name. Misreporting trans women’s murders by mis-gendering has been linked to problems with tracking murders of trans women nationwide and hampered police investigations of those murders. Mis-naming murder victims contributes to lack of police evidence as they attempt to speak to friends who might have known the victim by their chosen name but not their birth name.
> 
> GLAAD’s guidelines on trans people call for media to correctly identify and name trans people in news stories by their chosen names and gender markers.
