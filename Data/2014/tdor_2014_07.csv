She had a garment wrapped around her neck and foam coming from her mouth.

> The trans woman found dead Friday morning in the Industrial District of Teresina was identified by members of  the Piauiense Group of Transsexuals and Transvestites as Makelly Castro, who turned 24 on Wednesday. The coordinator of the group, Maria Laura dos Reis, confirmed that the girl was doing a program in the region of Teresina. 
> 
> ""We heard that she left her bike in front of a nightclub near Fripisa square and left with a client. She had been missing since then,"" he said. 
> 
> Makelly came to live in São Paulo and recently returned to Piauí.

In September 2015 Luis Augusto Antunes, a 31-year-old university professor, was arrested at his home and charged with killing her. However, in October 2017 he was acquitted of qualified homicide, despite being recognised by the court as being her killer.

> The 2nd People's Court of the Jury of Teresina acquitted the journalist and former university professor, Luís Augusto Antunes, accused of the murder of the transvestite [deadname], known as Makelly Castro. The trial took place on Thursday (05).
> 
> According to prosecutor Ubiraci Rocha, he will appeal the sentence because the jury acknowledged the author of the crime by the journalist, but acquitted him of the practice of the crime of qualified homicide: ""The Public Prosecutor's Office will appeal for a decision contrary to the evidence of the case and incompatibility in the response to the questions, for recognizing the authorship and absolving the practice of the crime. ""
> 
> For the prosecutor, the sentence ""demonstrates, unfortunately, the prejudice to the condition of the victim for being [a trans woman]"".

In January 2020 an outpatient clinic named after Makelly opened at the Getúlio Vargas Hospital in Teresina.
