In June 2017 her ex-boyfriend Angel Arias, 25, pled guilty on charges of second degree murder.

> Three more African-American transgender women have been reported murdered in the past few days, bringing the total of known transgender murder victims this year to 16, most of them trans women of color.
> 
> A body found Thursday in Johnston County, N.C., has been identified as that of Elisha Walker, 20, who had been reported missing by her family last fall, reports Charlotte TV station WSOC (watch below). Police found Walker’s remains buried behind a house near the town of Smithfield in Johnston County, after having found her car burned and abandoned in a field in another county.
>
> The car led them to Angel Arias, 23, a member of the Latin Kings gang. He has been charged with murder and felony vehicle theft, and was jailed in Johnston County without bond as he awaited transport to Rowan County, where Walker had lived, the station reports. Police have not cited a motive in the killing but say Walker apparently died of blunt force trauma.
>
> Walker was reported missing in November 2014, after her family had not heard from her since 24 October, the Salisbury Post reported. Police gave local media information about Walker’s disappearance in an effort to generate leads, but few were forthcoming until Walker’s burnt-out 2000 Pontiac Sunfire was discovered in an open field in Sampson County, police said in a [press] release.

> Two weeks ago Mikki Nicholson was hit by a train at Great Corby in Cumbria. It was around 7.30pm on Friday and she could have been sitting down to watch Coronation Street, or meeting friends for dinner – but instead she was on a dark, cold track, dying. Her family released a statement saying she had taken her own life.
> 
> Mikki was depressed. Mikki was a Scrabble champion. Mikki was transgender. She had tried to take her own life before but had always been saved by her network of supporters. No one knows what happened this time, though. She went to a lonely place and from there on to the loneliest place of all. I hope she finds the peace in death that evaded her in life.
> 
> I’ve added Mikki to the list of people I need to remember today, which is the Transgender Day of Remembrance (TDOR) – a ghostly crew of long-gone friends and people I almost met but never did, and never will. Like Andrea Waddell. She lived up the road from me back when I was in Brighton. A student and a sex worker – as was I, back then, although she was a bit older – she was murdered by a client. I met her family at my very first TDOR. They had the look of people who had been robbed of the thing that is most precious to them.

An inquest found that transphobia had contributed to her suicide.

> Prior to her death she had to leave her temporary accommodation – despite having been unable to find a new home – and was recorded as “intentionally homeless”.
> 
> According to the News and Star, community psychiatric nurse Clive Guyo said: “She described Carlisle as hostile to people who are different.
> 
> “She spoke of facing verbal abuse while walking in the streets because of how she appeared to other people.
> 
> “Schoolchildren were often the worst for making fun of her and verbally abusing her.
> 
> “She had a negative view of Carlisle based on past experience… she felt stigmatised.

Mikki's death was not recorded in the official TGEU TDoR 2015 list.

Detectives linked Mallory Porter, 18, to the crime through phone records and DNA evidence. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison after pleading guilty to a reduced charge of second-degree murder.

> In the early morning hours of November 12, Gizzy Fowler, a 24-year-old transgender woman of color, was fatally shot in the front yard of a north Nashville residence, according to Nashville news station WKRN-TV.
> 
> Neighbors called police at 5:27 a.m. on Wednesday after hearing a gunshot and seeing an unfamiliar white Buick LaCrosse, which authorities have identified as Fowler's, sitting in the driveway of the Bordeaux-area home. Seeing lights on inside the home, which neighbors knew to be unoccupied, they called police to report a possible burglary.
> 
> When police arrived, they found Fowler deceased near the open passenger door of her car. The residence showed no signs of forced entry. Police are still investigating why Fowler was on the property.
> 
> Fowler's identity was withheld until Friday, when her next-of-kin made a positive identification. Initially, WKRN-TV misidentified her as a ""man wearing women's clothes,"" and several local news stations misgendered Fowler, until the Tennessee Transgender Political Coalition announced that Fowler identified as a trans woman, notes Nashville's Out and About.
> 
> On Friday, the victim's mother, Tiffany Fowler, tearfully asked her community for answers through local news station WSMV-TV:
> 
> ""All I want to know is why,"" Fowler said. ""[She] loved people. [She] was just a genuine people person. … I just pray that we can get some answers on what happened. What did my child do to you > that was so bad, to make you do this to [her]. To take [her], why?""

Gizzy also used the name Breana.
