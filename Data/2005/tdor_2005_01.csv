> In July 2005, after three hours of deliberation, a jury convicted Ronnie Paris, Sr. of second degree manslaughter and aggravated child abuse in the death of his son. On August 19, 2005, he was sentenced to 30 years imprisonment, and ten years probation.The mother Nysheera Paris was sentenced to 5 years probation for culpable negligence in the death of her son.

Like [Mikey Vallejo-Seiber](https://tdor.translivesmatter.info/reports/2005/08/29/mikey-vallejo-seiber_riverside-california-usa_7c0f3e35) in August of the same year, we can obviously never know what Ronnie's gender identity would turn out to be. However, given the behaviour of the man who killed him, it is fitting that he be remembered here.
