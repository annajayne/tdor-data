Christina Smith,20,,,,12-Oct-2005,tdor.info/12 Oct 2005/Christina Smith,Houston,Texas,USA,29.760803,-95.369506,violence,shot,"Christina was shot, found dead with a single gunshot wound in the head in an apartment complex.

> A [woman] dressed in women's clothing was found dead in the courtyard of an apartment building in southwest Houston in the early morning of Oct. 12. The victim, Christopher Smith, suffered a single gunshot to the back of the head. Police at first believed the victim, [deadname] Smith, was a [cisgender] woman, but later learned she was a [trans woman] dressed in woman's clothing. Neighbors of the deceased told the Houston Chronicle that Smith was known to dress in ""flamboyant, reveal-ing tops, tight pants and padded bras.""
>
> Police have been unable to locate any next of kin to provide further details about the 20 year-old, whom neighbors described as ""loud and funny."" Neighbors reported hearing as many as five gunshots about the time Smith is believed to have been shot. Police say they have suspects but no motive in the slaying.


Christina was a Hurricane Katrina evacuee from New Orleans whom the Houston Chronicle misgendered as ""he"" and ""him"".

>Little is known about Smith, who called herself Christina. She had lived in a series of foster homes in Illinois prior to moving to New Orleans in 2003, police said. She and a roommate were evacuated to Houston following Hurricane Katrina. ""This person was a Katrina evacuee and had not made contact with the local TG community,"" transgender activist Phyllis Frye said. She was obviously murdered because she was out and TG, but the police refuse to investigate for hate crime."" Smith was murdered ""for her gender difference,"" Frye said.

She was a 60 year old post-operative trans woman who had been living in Kansas City, Kansas but had kept her birth name.

There was initially some suspicion that her death was a suicide, but additional details caused police to suspect a homicide.

> Months have passed and unanswered questions still linger in the case of a woman who was found dead near a rest stop on Interstate 29 near Glenwood.
>
> Kaaseem Adalla Juanda, 60, of Kansas City, was found underneath a tree about 100 yards from the main building on Oct. 17 with a single gunshot wound to the head. The medical examiner who performed the autopsy did not rule whether the incident was a homicide or a suicide and authorities have still not determined what happened. No suicide note was found.
>
> An unregistered gun was recovered underneath Juanda's body, but several tests performed on the weapon have not been able to determine who fired it. Although no clip was found in the gun, most guns will still fire without one.
>
> ""If there's a round in the chamber, the gun will still fire. You can release the magazine, but if the round is still in the chamber, the gun will fire,"" said Chief Deputy Jim Matthai of the Pottawattamie County Sheriff's Department.
>
> Investigating officers said Juanda had spent the majority of [her] life as a man before undergoing sexual reassignment surgery within the last few years while keeping the same name. According to Juanda's son, it may have been a motive for homicide. Derrick Juanda said his dad was involved with someone at the time of his death.
>
> ""My theory is that maybe this guy my dad was with found out my father used to be a man, so he put a hit on my father,"" Derrick said. ""The gunshot was towards the back of [her] head, execution style.""
Authorities have not been able to locate the Saudi Arabian man Juanda was dating.
