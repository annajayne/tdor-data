Kalola then strangled Carstens with a piece of electrical wire.Then Kalola allegedly stole a range of items - including a cellphone, a videocassette recorder, a radio, four silver necklaces, four pairs of golden earrings, and 12 tubes of lipstick - after forcing Carstens into submission by strangling [her].
