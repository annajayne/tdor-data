> NEW YORK - A retired state administrative judge, apparently driven to the brink by his [trans] son, shot and killed [them] in the family's fashionable Chelsea apartment and then killed his wife and himself.
>
> The bodies of Milton Goldman, 71, Phoebe Goldman, 70, and Richard Goldman, in [their] 40s, were found at 1:40 p.m. yesterday in their ninth floor London Terrace apartment. The younger Goldman, shot in the head, was in the living room. His mother, shot in the chest, lay on her bed.
>
> Milton Goldman also died in the bedroom. Police said he had shot himself in the mouth.
>
> The Goldmans apparently died together on Christmas Day or early Thursday. Doorman Andres Tirado noticed yesterday that newspapers from Thursday were piled up outside the apartment door. He found the bodies when he entered to investigate.
>
> An upstairs neighbor, Judy Richheimer, said she had known the Goldmans casually for nearly 20 years and had always been spooked by them.
>
> ""There was a lot of tension in the family,"" she said. ""Richie was very strange sweet, but strange and there were always the kind of parental remarks that speak volumes. It was always, 'Oh, whatever are we going to do about Richie?'""
>
> Another neighbor, Sonya Miller, said young Goldman was [trans]. ""[She] was very beautiful with
makeup,"" she said. ""[Their] parents were very disappointed, very much against it. I think this is what it was about.""
>
> Police had been called several times to break up fights between the parents and the son, she said. ""[They] used to hit them. He used to be very angry. They wanted [them] to act normal.""
>
> Agreed neighbor Richheimer: ""Richie had some social adjustment problems. You always had the feeling that all three of them were old people. Richie always seemed like a little old lady. [They] were better at being an old person than his parents were.""
>
> Police said the elder Goldman left a note saying he didn't know who would have cared for his son when he and his wife were gone.
