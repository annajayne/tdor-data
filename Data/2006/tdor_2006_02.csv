Alexis L. King,21,,,,3-Feb-2006,tdor.info/3 Feb 2006/Alexis (Brandon) L. King ,,,Philadelphia,Pennsylvania,USA,39.951061,-75.16562,violence,shot,"Alexis was shot attempting to flee a man who had propositioned her and then turned violent after discovering that she was trans.

Her killer Terron Oates was given just 5 to 10 years in jail for manslaughter and weapons offenses.

> A 20-year-old man who had killed a person he picked up for sex after learning that the person was [trans] - and not [cisgender] - was sentenced yesterday to five to 10 years in state prison on a voluntary-manslaughter conviction.
>
> Terron Oates was driving in his car from an after-hours strip club at Broad Street and Olney Avenue in the early morning of Feb. 3, 2006, when he picked up ""Alexis"" King, 21, who was outside waiting for a bus, Assistant District Attorney MK Feeney said yesterday.

King's [previous] name was [deadname] King. Oates, then 18, propositioned King for sex. Inside his car, Oates discovered that King, a [trans woman] male who dressed like a woman, had a penis.

Associated Press reported her death with the transphobic headline:  ""Hooker Who Is Man, Killed"". A Philadelphia inquirer article similarly reported the murder with the transphobic headline ""5 years in jail for killing a Woman who wasn't"".

> In February, Berry, a 21-year-old male-to-female [trans woman], was gunned down after stepping out of her front door at the Camelot Manor Apartments in South Memphis. The Memphis Police Department (MPD) originally thought the death was a robbery, but nothing was missing from Berry’s purse or apartment.
>
> Lieutenant Toney Armstrong with MPD’s homicide division says an arrest has been made in the case, but the police don’t have enough evidence to declare the murder a hate crime.

Yardena Marsh,46,,2006_02_15_Yardena-Marsh.jpg,https://awiderbridge.org/the-life-and-death-of-yardena-marsh/,15-Feb-2006,tdor.info/15 Feb 2006/Yardena Marsh,,,Tel Aviv,Tel Aviv,Israel,32.0566073,34.780704,violence,shot,"Yardena was shot dead in her apartment on Levanda Street. Ze’ev Biso admitted murdering her.

> Tel Aviv thief Ze’ev Biso was arrested by police on suspicion of murdering [trans woman] Yardena Marsh,” reads the news story published on March 24, 2006 in Yediot Aharonot. “Her body was found yesterday in her apartment on Levanda street with one bullet in the chest that caused her death.” Thus ended the life of Yardena Marsh Z”L, a pioneer of the transgender community in Israel, who was found dead in her modest apartment near the central bus station in Tel Aviv.
>
> Marsh grew up in South Tel Aviv and attended boarding school when she was a teenager. Her gender identity began to be expressed after she had finished army service. “I met Yardena Marsh during my teenage years. We grew up together in the same neighborhood, we roamed around the same parks,” says Israela Lev, who was Yardena’s friend and roommate. “We became very good friends, sisters even, and even emigrated together to West Berlin in the 80s. We lived in a very small apartment and we shared it on a really low budget. We just had to go, because the authorities and the police in Israel harassed us. Later we heard that life is better in Switzerland, so we moved there together. Yardena was one of the most charming women I’ve ever met, with a sense of humor and a laugh and a beautiful face. She had bright green eyes and curly hair. She was captivating in her grace and naivety. She loved life and had a sense of adventure.”
>
> At a certain point Yardena Marsh began working in prostitution and was dragged into drug addiction that degraded her life. Israela Lev says that at that point their lives separated. “When we got back to Israel, we lived in Tel Aviv and we got into a mess quite often because of Yardena and her efforts to get to know the dark regions of drug dealers,” she says. “These drugs did her a lot of damage, and when I saw her every once in a while in Tel Aviv, I tried to talk to her and see if there was any way I could help her, but she couldn’t give up the addiction, and always got back to the drugs, until eventually I read in the newspaper that she was murdered. She was a beautiful transgender woman, both inside and out,” Lev says.
>
> Nora Grinberg was in touch with Yardena Marsh’s family following her murder, and tried to convince them to bury her with dignity. “Yardena was murdered twice. Once by the murderer and again by her family who wiped out her identity,” she says. “The unwillingness to honor her after she was dead was burned inside me forever. They referred to her as a man and all they would say was how much she hurt her mother. They didn’t really care about her and there was no willingness to respect her identity and her memory after she was murdered.”

Gisberta Salce Junior,45,,2006_02_22_Gisberta-Salce-Junior.jpg,https://www.pensarcontemporaneo.com/conheca-historia-de-gisberta-trans-brasileira-assassinada-em-portugal/,22-Feb-2006,tdor.info/22 Feb 2006/Gisberta Salce Junior,,,Porto,Norte,Portugal,41.149456,-8.610766,violence,tortured and drowned,"Gisberta was tortured by a group of 14 teenagers from St. Jos Center (""a strict Catholic school for boys""). She ultimately died by drowning after they threw her into a pit of water.

> ""According to the case, they told the others that they knew a ""man"" with ""tits"" and that ""he looked like a woman"". That's how 14 boys got together, eager to meet the transsexual, and the abandoned building became a rendezvous point - and some of the teenagers started attacking Gisberta.
> 
> As of February 15, 2006, they began to group together to commit multiple acts of violence against women who were beaten, raped and humiliated over three days, with stones, beatings - the pieces of wood were also used to rape her - and cigarette burns.
> 
> Between 21 and 22 of the same month, the young people returned to the place and found the Brazilian unconscious. Believing she was dead, they thought of ways to disappear with her body and threw her into the pit of the building, filled with water. She was unconscious, but alive, and died drowned.
> 
> One of the students confessed the crime to a teacher and the body was discovered the same day. The case quickly made the news, which treated Gisberta in the male and extremely derogatory way.

Gisberta was a Brazilian immigrant who lived in Porto. A transgender, homeless woman, living illegally in Europe, she had left Brazil for France at the age of 18 to escape a wave of murders in Sao Paulo that victimized trans people.

Of her attackers, only one was over 16 years old and could be criminally punished, Vitor Santos (who according to his colleagues, did not attack the victim, only observed the others) was sentenced to 8 months imprisonment for the crime of omission of aid. The others were sentenced to 13 months in the Educational Center; by September 2007 all were already free.

Frustration with the outcome of the trial led to an intense mobilisation by activists who adopted Gisberta as a symbol of transphobia ande won protective laws for trans people in Portugal. For example, since 2011, it has been possible for trans people to rectify their documents without the need for surgeries.


Even 15 years after her death, Gisberta was still being deadnamed by the media.

<blockquote class=""twitter-tweet""><p lang=""pt"" dir=""ltr"">O uso do “nome morto” e de incongruências de género nas notícias sobre pessoas trans persiste. 15 anos após a sua trágica morte, Gisberta sofreu ontem este tratamento.

> The use of the “dead name” and gender inconsistencies in news about transgender people persists. 15 years after hertragic death, Gisberta underwent this treatment [again] yesterday. It is therefore important to understand what the “dead name” is and how it is harmful to trans people.


Gisberta's story later became a play, a documentary and the song Balada de Gisberta, composed by the Portuguese Pedro Abrunhosa and played by Maria Bethânia. A street was also named after her.

In March 2021 an online petition to name a street in Porto after Gisberta was launched. Just over a year later, it happened.

> In February 2006, Gisberta Salce Júnior, a 45-year-old HIV positive Brazilian [trans woman] and [sex worker], was assaulted and raped by 14 teenagers for several days and found dead in a 15-meter well. The tragic episode shocked the city and caused the country to debate intolerance and hatred against homosexuals, but also issues related to transphobia and gender equality.
>
> Fifteen years later, the Organizing Committee of the Porto Pride March (COMOP), an organization founded to combat the oppression to which LGBTI + people are subjected, considers that ""it is time to recognize and honor the life of Gisberta Salce Júnior"".
>
> This Wednesday, they launched an online petition to the Commission of Toponymy, created together with actress and activist Sara Barros Leitão, which proposes that one of the streets of the city be named Gisberta, considering this “a giant step towards representation , as well as a source of pride for the city of Porto”. ""The initiative aims to promote a reflection on how we can make Porto a more inclusive city and how we can combat the oppression to which LGBT + people are subjected"", reads a statement.
