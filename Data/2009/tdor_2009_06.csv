> VOLGOGRAD, June 24 [2009]. In Volgograd, the murder of a woman with whom her common-law husband was dealt was investigated. According to NEWSru Israel, the victim’s shocking past was the motive for the murder: she was a [trans woman] and underwent sex reassignment surgery.
>
> The couple met two years ago during a trip to St. Petersburg. In the Northern capital, Vladimir felt attracted to his compatriot Camilla and, returning home, immediately offered the girl to move to him.
>
> At the same time, Vladimir was not embarrassed that his beloved was reluctant to talk about his past. He only knew that Camille grew up in Tiraspol, studied at Chisinau University, but did not go to graduate school.
>
> After two years of marriage, Vladimir offered Camille a hand and a heart, but she rejected his offer, saying that she was not ready for such a serious step. “We are fine without paper formalities,” she said.
>
> However, such an answer kindled jealousy in a man, and he decided at all costs to find out the secret of his beloved's past. Since then, Vladimir began to monitor the woman. He hacked into Camilla's email and found correspondence with her Tiraspol friends. However, all the recipients for some reason turned to his beloved as a man.
>
> Vladimir began to correspond on behalf of Camille and found out that in the past she really was a [trans woman] called [deadname]. Then came the sex-change operation that was done in Australia, and after returning to her homeland, Camilla changed her documents.
>
> Vladimir did not suffer the shock well. He took a gun and went to meet her at the railway station. Soon, the corpse of 30-year-old Camilla was found not far from the Donskaya railway platform with traces of a gunshot wound in the [groin].
>
> After that, the 33-year-old crime suspect tried to commit suicide by leaving a suicide note. Vladimir cut his veins, but was saved. Now the accused of murder awaits trial.

She had been strangled and shot in the head.

She was a sex worker and transgender activist.

> New York, July 17, 2009) The International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission (IGLHRC) strongly condemns the recent murder and arbitrary arrests of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) activists in Honduras. IGLHRC has learned that these human rights abuses have occurred as a direct result of the military coup on June 28, 2009, which ousted that country’s democratically elected government. The coup was apparently precipitated by now-exiled President Manuel Zelaya’s attempts to amend the constitution and seek an additional 4-year term in office after his original term expired in 2010.
>
> “The recent coup in Honduras is an illegal assault on democracy that violates the rights of all Honduran citizens, including those who identify as LGBT,” said IGLHRC executive director Cary Alan Johnson. “We especially deplore the vicious murder and arbitrary arrests of LGBT people in the wake of this crisis.”
>
> The transgender activist’s murder occurred on the night of June 29, 2009, after she went to work during the military-imposed two-night curfew. She was found dead in the morning of June 30, 2009, one block away from San Pedro Sula’s Gay Community Center, with two gunshot wounds: one through her head and one in her back. Local activists in Honduras claim she was killed by military police patrolling the streets. Representatives from Colectivo TTT/REDLACTRANS have protested the murder.

In November 2020 the Inter-American Court is to hold a hearing against the state of Honduras into her extra-judicial killing.

> San José, Oct 29 (EFE) .- The Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACHR) reported this Thursday that in its November session it will hold a hearing for the alleged extrajudicial execution of a transsexual activist in Honduras and another for the alleged disappearance of a person with a mental disability in Ecuador.
>
> On November 11 and 12, the Inter-American Court, based in Costa Rica, will hold the public hearing, virtually, in the case of Hernández et al. Against Honduras. The case is related to the alleged international responsibility of the State for the alleged extrajudicial execution of Vicky Hernández, a transsexual woman and human rights defender, between the night of June 28 and the early morning of June 29, 2009, while a curfew was in effect.
