> 
> In [her] first statements, [deadname] Dávila López, originally from San Marcos, Carazo, maintained that [she] is innocent, because even though there was a conflict between all the members of the group that remained in front of the church, [she] was not capable of attacking anyone, and indirectly accused the [trans woman] nicknamed ""La Shakira"", because according to [her], this was the one who the authorities occupied the knife. 
> 
> ""Like three times we fought ... the shirt I was wearing had blood, because they hurt my face, but the stab was for me,"" said ""La Luisona"", in an attempt to go from victimizer to victim.
> 
> [She] adds that the whole problem was due to a debt of money that [she] had with one of the litigators, but on the contrary of what the police investigations point out, [she] had a very good friendship for several years with ""La Gaby"". 
> 
> On Monday morning, a preliminary hearing was held in the Criminal Hearing Court, where the Public Prosecutor accused Luis Dávila of murder, while the judicial judge ordered preventive detention and scheduled the initial hearing for Wednesday, at eight o'clock. in the morning.
> 
> The National Police first detained five [trans women] who were there at the time of the incident, but the results of the Criminalistics Laboratory indicate that the knife with which [deadname] Rosales Aragón was killed has Luis Dávila's fingerprints and that [she] had bloodstains from the deceased on [her] shirt.

According to her brother, the motive was jealousy. The exact date she died is unknown, but it was reportedly sometime in January 2009.

Pérola's murder was not reported on the official TDoR 2009 list. It only came to light as a result of her alleged killer being murdered herself 10 years later (see https://tdor.translivesmatter.info/reports/2019/01/21/quelly-da-silva-jeninha_campinas-sao-paulo-brazil_addd1f7c).

> In fact the same [Jeninha/Quelly da Silva] lived 4 years in a friend's house and went on the run ... the msm used the name of Jheninha and (Quelly) on social networks ... which tbm left the run of her hometown in Belém from because she took the life of a 17 year old trans girl with multiple stab wounds and nothing was done about it.
> 
> Witnesses including the victim's cousin saw the stabbing and in the desperation to rescue the victim the murderer managed to run away. She was picked up later but was released....Pérola was a friend of this murderous trans woman in Campinas and gave a home and food to her own assassin. If you lived in the neighborhood, you would know the whole story.
