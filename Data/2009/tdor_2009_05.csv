> PROVOCATION DEFENCE WIPED - DIKSY JONES, 2009. Lower Hutt trans woman Diksy Jones died from blunt force trauma to the head after being bashed by David Shaun Galloway (then 18) and Phillip Christopher Sanders (then 42) in her Upper Hutt home in April 2009. In sentencing, Justice Robert Dobson said the younger man’s part in the ""brutal and tragic"" attack constituted a hate crime, as Galloway had stated ‘a transvestite did not deserve to live’ and that he ‘believed in Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve’.
