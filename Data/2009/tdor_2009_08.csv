She was a young trans woman who had a degree in Spanish from the University of Algiers, but after being abandoned by her family she had no choice but to earn a living as a sex worker.

> I received the news today from a friend of mine, an Algerian LGBT activist, who is now Belgium after he escaped for asylum. A brutal murder took the life of a young transsexual woman. She had a degree in Spanish from the University of Algiers. Her family threw her out on the street and, on the street, she could only find work as a sex worker to support herself. She lived in Algiers and went out every night to corners and streets frequented by sex workers and their customers.
>
> One night, four weeks ago, she was attacked by a group of strangers who beat her up severely. In the hospital, she arrived badly injured and died shortly after.
>
> She is one of many other transsexuals who fight for their lives constantly, day in and day out, in the Arab world. I hear of many transsexuals who die every year in Algeria. This one was reported to my friend by someone who works in the national HIV prevention program. How many others go unreported? The authorities are indifferent in the face of discrimination, and all of us who are silent are accomplices in these murders.
>
> Rest in peace, little sister, and if God exists, let him know I am outraged at this injustice.
>
> Contributed by Randa Lamri, a trans activist.

The exact date of her death is unknown, but it was sometime in the first two weeks of August.

Although the other victim survived but Tyli'a died from her injuries.

The police investigated the death as a possible hate crime.

> A 21-year-old transgender woman who went by the name of Tyli’a Mack was stabbed to death in DC on August 26th, 2009. Tyli’a and a second transgender victim were found by police at 2:30 p.m. [at the 200 block of Q Street, NW] about two blocks away from the offices of Transgender Health Empowerment (T.H.E.), a social services organization that offers drop-in services to transgender people. Mack was pronounced dead at the Howard University Hospital approximately 30 minutes after being found. The second victim was also taken to a hospital. She was in stable condition and expected to recover. 
>
> People were saddened and angered across the country when hearing about the tragic incident in DC. One Struggle, One Fight organized a candlelight vigil in San Francisco, and members of the local LGBTQ community congregated at 18th & Castro on Saturday evening in rememberance of the life of Tyli’a Mack.
>
> Approximately 30-40 people attended the vigil in San Francisco, and when the numbers and emotions seemed too big to contain on a streetcorner, the group occupied the intersection. Many participants were in tears as the group chanted in unison, demanding justice for Mack and an end to transphobia. Towards the end of the event, Sister MaeJoy B. WithU called for a moment of silence, and the sidewalk was eventually lined with candles and photos.

Note that tdor.info gave Tyli'a's age as 18.

The suspected murderer, Jesus Catalan (also known as Brian Nanes or Luis Santiago), was later apprehended by authorities.

Catalan was a homeless person who was known to frequent transgender sex workers.

> Police this afternoon officially announced an arrest in last year's brutal murder of Paulina Ibarra. Jesus Catalan stands accused of killing the 24-year-old transgender woman in her East Hollywood apartment on August 28th, 2009. Catalan became an immediate person of interest a few hours after police reported to Ibarra's home on the 900 block of Mariposa Street. Catalan apparently contacted mutual friends in the LGBT community after the murder, claiming he was a victim of a robbery and was in need of help. Once with them, he put on new clothes and left. When those friends learned of Ibarra's death, they stepped forward with information and his bloody clothes, police said.
>
> Since then, Catalan was on the loose, even getting the attention of ""America's Most Wanted"" last December. Then on July 3rd, he was arrested in Tijuana after a disturbance at a motel. Because he was a U.S. citizen -- born in Puerto Rico -- he was transferred to the U.S. Border Patrol. A fingerprint scan alerted the LAPD, which brought him back to Los Angeles to face one charge of murder. A hearing is set for July 19th.
>
> Police do not believe it was a hate crime.
