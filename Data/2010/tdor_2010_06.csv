Sandy Woulard,28,,,,21-Jun-2010,"tgeu/21 Jun 2010/""Credale"" Woulard",75th and Halsted,,Chicago,Illinois,USA,41.757742,-87.6463948,violence,shot,"Sandy was found lying in the street. She died in hospital.

> It is estimated that one in 12 people who are transgender will die through violence in the United States. On the morning of June 21, Sandy Woulard—a resident of the 7700 block of South Ada—became such a person. Her body was found by a passing motorist near the corner of 75th and Halsted. Authorities report that Woulard died from a fatal gunshot wound to her chest leaving her dead at the scene.
>
> Chicago's transgender community has called for a response to local media coverage of Woulard's death, stating that references to Woulard in the Chicago Sun-Times as a ""man dressed in women's clothing"" are offensive and lack sensitivity to issues surrounding gender identity. The blogosphere lit up following Woulard's shooting with comments from members of the community offering various statements about the slaying.
>
> A blog for the transgender-advocacy organization Genderqueer Chicago featured a plea that members write to the Sun-Times and express their outrage over how the paper covered Woulard's death. Another online forum featured a brief goodbye letter to Woulard from someone who knows the victim and her family. But the overriding sentiment expressed by those in the transgender community and others who know Woulard, is that media treatment of people who are transgender is generally unpalatable.
