Her murderer Andrew Olacirequi was arrested after returning to the crime scene to find his lost cell phone. He pled guilty to second degree reckless homocide.

> Dana is described by Brenda Coley, a friend, as someone who ""deeply cared about her community and was very authentic. She loved her family dearly and they accepted her for who she is. She was a delightful person with a sophisticated sense of humor and there are things she knew she could have taught us. Our lives would have been better because of it.""
> 
> Unfortunately, coverage on Dana's death used many incorrect stereotypes and terminology about transgender people, and advocated the problematic 'transgender panic' defense, while blaming Dana for her own murder.
