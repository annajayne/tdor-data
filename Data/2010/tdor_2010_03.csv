She had been strangled, her apartment trashed and her laptop stolen.

In November 2013 Rasheen Everett, 32, was sentenced to 25 years to life for her murder.

> A New York defence attorney has caused outrage by claiming a murderer of a trans woman shouldn’t face the same punishment as if he had killed someone ‘in the higher end of the community’.
> 
> John Scarpa made the claim on Thursday (05 December) as his client, Rasheen Everett, was sentenced to 25 years to life for the brutal murder of Amanda Gonzalez-Andujar in 2010.
> 
> Speaking on Everett’s sentence, Scarpa said: ‘A sentence of 25 years to life is an incredibly long period of time, Judge. Shouldn’t that be reserved for people who are guilty of killing certain classes of individuals?
> 
> ‘Who is the victim in this case? Is the victim a person in the higher end of the community?’
> 
> Scarpa was immediately scolded by the judge, Supreme Justice Richard Butcher, who said: ‘This court believes every human life is sacred… It’s not easy living as a transgender, and I commend the family for supporting her.
> 
> Everett, 32, was convicted of murdering Gonzalez-Andujar last month.
> 
> After meeting for sex in March 2010, Everett found Gonzalez-Andujar had male genitalia. He then proceeded to strangle and stab her. Gonzalez-Andujar’s naked body was found in her apartment days later, which had been ransacked.
> 
> Everett showed no remorse during the trial – even going so far as to chuckle through an emotional testimony by Gonzalez-Andujar’s brother, who said: ‘The pain my family feels is unbearable… It’s all like a nightmare, and I’m still waiting to wake up.’
> 
>  At the sentencing, Butcher criticized Everett, saying: ‘The defendant is coldhearted and a violent menace to society’.

A friend of Amanda commented, “She was such a sweet person.  She was loved by everyone, so I just can’t figure who would do something like that to her.”
