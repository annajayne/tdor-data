Jones told police he had struck the infant several times with a closed fist, saying that he was ""trying to make him act like a boy instead of a little girl.""

We'll obviously never know what Roy's gender identity would ultimately turn out to be, but given how they died it is fitting that they be remembered by our community. Rest in power, little one.

> The Shinnecock Indian Nation came together on Monday night to mourn the death of one of their youngest members, 16-month-old Roy Antonio Jones III.
> 
> Nearly 100 tribe members shed tears and honored the life of the toddler, who died Sunday evening of cardiac arrest after authorities said he was beaten by his mother’s boyfriend at her home on the Shinnecock Indian Reservation.
> 
> The candlelight prayer vigil was held hours after 20-year-old Pedro Jones of Southampton, who is not a member of the Shinnecock Indian Nation, pleaded not guilty to first-degree manslaughter in Southampton Town Justice Court in connection with the toddler’s death. If convicted of the Class B violent felony, he faces five to 25 years in prison, according to the Suffolk County district attorney’s office.
> 
> According to a felony complaint filed with the Town Justice Court on Monday, August 2, police said that Mr. Jones caused the child’s death by “striking him several times throughout his body with his closed fists and grabbing him by the neck.”
> 
> Also, according to court documents of a police interview, Mr. Jones reportedly spoke with his parents from Southampton Hospital, where Roy was pronounced dead, and told them that he “killed Vanessa’s son and that he punched him too hard.” According to his comments in the documents, Mr. Jones said he was “trying to make him act like a boy instead of a little girl.”

She was a sex worker and at the time was waiting for customers on Second Street, Second Avenue of the Barandillas neighborhood, opposite the La Plaza building.

Imperia was the president of the executive committe of the Honduran Colectivo Unidad Color Rosa (Colectivo TTT), and according to Colectivo TTT, the men appeared to be police officers.

> Imperia was an HIV / AIDS educator and also worked on human rights issues.
> 
> The circumstances of her death are not entirely clear. Apparently, two miscreants on a motorcycle approached her to ask her how much she charged for her services and then shot her at least four times. The young woman apparently arrived at the hospital alive, but died as a result of her injuries.
> 
> Just two days ago we wrote about the growing climate of violence against LGBT people in Honduras as a result of another terrible event: the murder of a witness who had dared to testify against a policeman accused of the murder of a transsexual woman.
