She was a founding member of the  Black Pink Triangle Izmir LGBTT Association.

> Azra, the first member of Black Pink, was killed just as Black Pink was finally brought before the court. Eventually, on the third hearing, the judge announced the decision in favor of Black Pink with these words: ""Like other citizens, lesbians, gays, bisexuals, and transgender people have a right to create associations. For this reason, the case is dismissed.""
> 
> Black Pink has thus experienced two contradictory events in one week; the loss of one of its founding members as well as its formal recognition as an organization. Black Pink dedicates its legal victory to the memory of Azra. We will start operating as a registered group to end hate crimes and discrimination. We will have a long and difficult journey ahead of us, but know that fighting for respect for our communities is as important now as ever.
> 
> Rest in peace, Azra.
