> 
> The body of Myra Chanel Ical, 51, was abandoned in a field on the 4300 block of Garrott near the Southwest Freeway and Richmond. She was from Guatemala and has no known relatives in the Houston area. 
> 
> The vigil was held in the same field where Ical's body was found around 2:00 P.M. on Jaunary 18, 2010. The Transgender Foundation of America in Houston aimed to give the victim a voice and to make sure the public knows about her death.

> ""She was just a trans woman trying to make it, trying to survive, trying to get a job, keep a job and unfortunately she ran into the wrong people,"" said Phyllis Frye, a transgender attorney.
