Nothing was taken.

> On September 6 in Medellín Antioquia, in the Barrio Castilla, at 2:00 p.m., and a few meters from her family home, María Camila Parra was murdered. They were two individuals dressed up in the uniform of a parabolic television company.
>
> She was shot 6 times inside her car and that killed her. Camila had no enemies because she had just arrived in Colombia after being away for two and a half years; It is unusual because they killed her just 7 days after arriving. In Europe, Rome, where she lived for 12 years, she had no enemies, was a very funny and popular girl. At the time of the aggression inside her car, nothing was stolen, they found her purse full of money, and her jewellry on her body.
>
> It was a very heinous crime as she was shot 6 times in the stomach. Camilita had built an extensive heritage. She was always helping her family, which she lifted from poverty and gave all her generosity. A young rebel, who dreamed of a better future; having not long ago reassigned her sex. She did not deserve to die near her home, in the country for which he always felt homesick.

They died from blunt-force trauma to the head.

There are indications that they may have been in the early stages of transition, but we will never know for sure.

> [Dr] Gopalan, 35, an aerospace engineer and highly acclaimed local theater director, was found dead on the sidewalk in the 2600 block of 11th Street, N.W., about 5:20 a.m. on Saturday, Sept. 10, 2011.
>
> Friends and Bob Shaeffer, [their] partner of nearly five years, said [they] identified as a gay man over the many years they knew [them]. But police said when [they were] found unconscious on the sidewalk a short distance from [their] home in the Columbia Heights neighborhood, [they were] dressed in women’s clothes and appeared to have been carrying a pair of women’s high heel shoes.
>
> With no identification documents found in [their] possession, it took police several days to track down [their] identity. And with no obvious signs of trauma or injury, it took authorities nearly two weeks to determine from an autopsy that the cause of death was blunt force trauma to the head. The city’s Medical Examiner ruled the death a homicide.
>
> Shaeffer told the Washington City Paper that on the Friday night prior to Gopalan’s murder early Saturday morning [they] told Shaeffer he planned to go out to some of the straight clubs on U Street, N.W. Police have said they obtained video of someone appearing to be Gopalan walking along U Street from surveillance cameras in that area. But they said employees of some of the bars in the area could not recall whether he had been to their establishments. The gay bars Town and Nellie’s are in that area.
>
> Similar to nearly all of the unsolved murders of LGBT people since the year 2000, police told the Blade last week the case remains open and has been assigned to the Homicide Branch’s Cold Case Squad. Police have not disclosed whether they have determined a motive or identified a potential suspect in the case.
>
> In the last months of his life Shaeffer and others who knew Gopalan said [they] began dressing occasionally in women’s clothes and said [they] were going by the name of Gigi during times when he took on a female persona.
>
> D.C. transgender activist Earline Budd, who said she has spoken to some people who knew Gopalan, believes Gopalan may have been in the early stages of transitioning as a transgender woman. Regardless of what Gopalan’s actual gender identity was, Budd said she’s concerned that the beloved engineer and Shakespeare theater director may have been targeted because of the perception that [they] were a transgender woman at a time when trans women had been subjected to violent attacks in D.C.

All had been beaten and asphixiated after being locked in a train container wagon. Their hands were also tied.

On 17th September local media, spread a rumour that Brigitte had been murdered inside her home, however the authorities never confirmed this and her body was found 3 days later thrown in front of a commercial plaza. Her murder shocked Veracruz society as it seemed to represent and symbolise the violence perpetrated by drug traffickers in the State of Veracruz.

> They had killed her before. For some reason, her death had acquired obsession in Veracruz and Boca del Rio, where xhe had become a notoriety, perhaps even fame. With her miniskirt and transparent heels, she had achieved the status of a reference point for Buenos Aires nights.
> 
> From time to time, the rumor of her untimely passing had passed through the harbor, as if any blond hair found in unfortunate circumstances was hers: she was found dead in a ditch, in an apartment, in a car, in a luxury house...
> 
> Never, of course, was her death confirmed. Always the news about her death turned out, as Mark Twain would say, terribly exaggerated. ""I found out because my mom came looking for me very scared,"" she said the last time she was sent three meters underground, just on Friday of last week, shortly before posting on her Metroflog profile, at the foot of a photo in which she appears in a jacuzzi, a single word: ""mannequin"".
> 
> Until now. It seems that the story finally reached Brigeth, the platinum blonde who worked for six years at the corner of Juan Pablo II and Costa Verde, sometimes in a hotel, sometimes in the leather seats of a red Mini Cooper. The lady who created a payment system for media interviews - one thousand pesos per hour - and who once threatened to publicize the list of her clients if the local police did not let her work the street in peace.
> 
> With the finding of 35 bodies on the roundabout of the Papantla flyerover came the revelation: Brigeth was in the pile. Or at least that's what a local official says.
> 
> More broadly, it has not been an ignored topic. The local media have dedicated paragraphs to speculate that, now, the blonde did not escape and lies in one of the plates of the Forensic Medical Service. Photographs of candles left by bystanders at his truck stop, his office, circulate in different veracruzanos portals.
> 
> Yesterday she was not at his place of work. It seemed then that the news of her death had reached her and that the blonde finally died at the fourth.
> 
> Or maybe not. And one of these nights the Red Mini Cooper will appear on the hill overlooking its street, rolling slowly until it reaches the corner so that a golden heel can descend from its open door.

> Reforma publishes today that the murder of 35 people whose bodies appeared in Boca del Río on September 20 occurred with blows of sticks and pipes and asphyxiation after being locked in a train container wagon. The bodies had metal burns on their torso and legs because they were recharged in the container to be tied with plastic safety seals, which have a safety clasp.
> 
> According to sources close to the investigations of the case, which were consulted by Reforma, the manner in which they were murdered and the use of that type of ties do not correspond to the torture or homicide patterns of the narco groups that operate in the State of Veracruz The informants indicated that the plastic seals have been used by institutional security bodies and by Navy and Army personnel. ""Those (precincts) only have them in the United States or are used by special forces from here: Navy or the Army,"" said the state source who had access to the first inquiries and asked to omit his name. The multiple murder occurred in a place known as Santa Fe, about 30 kilometers from the port of Veracruz.
> 
> The bodies also had traces of dirt, apparently for having been dragged to then put them in redilla vans, they refer the stagecoaches, and transport them to the Ruiz Cortines Boulevard in Boca del Río, where they were thrown on September 20 in the afternoon. The investigations, so far, have not resulted in any detention. ""Those who did it are subjects who know how to hit, torture; trained people, ""the sources said.
