"Alina ""Klia"" Dian",26,13-Dec-1984,2011_01_02_Alina-Klia-Dian.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/aljadian/photos?lst=651194372%3A740753909%3A1562927247,2-Jan-2011,tgeu/Jan-2011/N.N.,Pishchevka,Kostroma Oblast,Russia,58.586513,45.460006,violence,murdered,"Alina was found dead in a disused building in Picshevka on 2nd January. The building was padlocked from the outside and her body showed signs of her having been raped, but police classified the case as suicide and closed it.

> Klia has become a unifying figure for many communities, not just within the transgender community.
> 
> Her Facebook profile is still sent birthday greetings by people who knew her in person or via the Internet
> 
> Klia's murder was also one of the reasons behind the organisation of a project to offer legal assistance to transgender people in the former Soviet states.

Alina's Facebook profile is https://www.facebook.com/aljadian, and she also had a profile at http://cupressus.diary.ru/. The latter reveals her birthday to have been 13th December 1984, so she was just 26 when she died.

Although the official TDoR 2011 list released by Transgender Europe (TGEU) in November 2011 listed her as an unidentified victim, we were finally able to remember her by her true name as a result of one of her friends contacting us via Twitter.
