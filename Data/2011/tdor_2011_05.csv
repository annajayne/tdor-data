Her body had also been dragged by a car and then been thrown into a sewer. The police investigated on the basis that the motive may have been homophobia and drug-related vengeance, relating the case to the murder of [Mailda dos Santos](https://tdor.translivesmatter.info/reports/2011/06/08/mailda-dos-santos-maria-do-bairro_lagoa-encantada-cuiaba-mato-grosso-brazil_23f5eb73), which took place on 8th June 2011 in the same area of Cuiaba.

> On Saturday, [deadname] was found in the Gumita stream with a rope around her neck. Investigations indicate that she was killed by strangulation and dragged for several meters before being was thrown into the stream. The corpse was located late Saturday morning in a place that was difficult to access, in the Três Lagoas neighborhood in Cuiabá. 

On 31st June 2020, four men were killed in a confrontation with Military Police. One of them was suspected to have been responsible for the murder of both Alicinha and [Mailda dos Santos](https://tdor.translivesmatter.info/reports/2011/06/08/mailda-dos-santos-maria-do-bairro_lagoa-encantada-cuiaba-mato-grosso-brazil_23f5eb73).

> One of the four killed in confrontation with the Mobile Tactical Ostensive Rounds Battalion (Rotam), yesterday afternoon (31) on MT-351, in Estrada de Manso, Cleberson Rodrigo, 33, was arrested in September 2011, by the Civil Police, for involvement in the homicide of two [trans women] due to drug debt. At the time he was 23 years old, and was known for trafficking in the CPA region. The investigations pointed out that debt was not the only motivation for the crimes, ""but it is as if these people were going to the chase, expressing a prejudice existing in them, hence the explanation for the torture and cruelty of the crimes"", says an excerpt from the complaint.

The body of the first victim, [deadname] da Cruz, 19, was found on May 28 of that year, inside a stream, on the border bridge of the Três Lagoas neighborhood with Vila Rosa, in Cuiabá, asphyxiated with a rope. Ten days later, on June 8, the [trans woman] Mailda dos Santos Silva, 33, was murdered in a similarly cruel fashion. Her body was found in the CPA III neighborhood, at the back of Lagoa Encantada.
