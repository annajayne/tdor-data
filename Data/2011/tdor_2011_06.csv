Her body was found with three bullet wounds at an intersection in San Juan's Santurce district.

Before she was killed, two people in an old car had approached several trans women to enquire whether they had seen Karlota. One of the trans women reported that one of the individuals showed a firearm to those they asked. None of them called the police.

> Primera Hora reported that Puerto Rico Police Cmdr. Orlando Meléndez identified the victim as [deadname] Gómez Peña. Meléndez told the newspaper that the victim was ""dressed as a woman."" Pedro Julio Serrano of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force identified the victim as Karlota Gómez Sánchez.
>
> ""What we have is [the victim] approached a vehicle and there were shots,"" Orlando Meléndez told a local radio station.
>
> LGBT activist Ada Conde told Primera Hora that local authorities should investigate Gómez's death as a hate crime.
>
> ""It is imperative that in this case the authorities follow Attorney General Obdulio Meléndez's order that prosecutors investigate the hate angle in all crimes committed against any member of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual and transgender communities,"" added Serrano in a statement. ""On the other hand, we have to elevate our voices on what is clearly an epidemic of homophobic and transphobic violence.""

Mailda dos Santos (Maria do Bairro),25,,,,8-Jun-2011,tgeu/8-Jun-2011/Mailda dos Santos (Maria do Bairro),"Lagoa Encantada, Cuiaba",Mato Grosso,Brazil,-15.57432,-56.08663,violence,beaten,"Mailda's body was found by a student who called the police.

The circumstances of her murder are reported to have been similar to the murder of [Alicinha da Cruz](https://tdor.translivesmatter.info/reports/2011/05/28/alicinha-da-cruz_tres-lagoas-cuiaba-mato-grosso-brazil_216a97d2), which took place on 28th May 2011 in the same area of Cuiaba.

On 31st June 2020, four men were killed in a confrontation with Military Police. One of them was suspected to have been responsible for the murder of both Mailda and Alicinha.

> One of the four killed in confrontation with the Mobile Tactical Ostensive Rounds Battalion (Rotam), yesterday afternoon (31) on MT-351, in Estrada de Manso, Cleberson Rodrigo, 33, was arrested in September 2011, by the Civil Police, for involvement in the homicide of two [trans women] due to drug debt. At the time he was 23 years old, and was known for trafficking in the CPA region. The investigations pointed out that debt was not the only motivation for the crimes, ""but it is as if these people were going to the chase, expressing a prejudice existing in them, hence the explanation for the torture and cruelty of the crimes"", says an excerpt from the complaint.

The body of the first victim, [deadname] da Cruz, 19, was found on May 28 of that year, inside a stream, on the border bridge of the Três Lagoas neighborhood with Vila Rosa, in Cuiabá, asphyxiated with a rope. Ten days later, on June 8, the [trans woman] Mailda dos Santos Silva, 33, was murdered in a similarly cruel fashion. Her body was found in the CPA III neighborhood, at the back of Lagoa Encantada.

Her body was found near a dumpster.

Police released a sketch of the alleged perpetrator, who is assumed to be a man in his late 20s to early 30s.

tdor.info identifies the victim as ""Miss Nate Nate (or Née) Eugene Davis"".

> Known as “Miss Nate Nate,” the victim, née Nathan Eugene Davis, was pronounced dead on the scene.  Trans community members are rallying to call attention to this latest brutal murder perpetrated against the Houston transgender population.  Ms. Davis was known by merchants and residents in the area and had contact with the police in the days prior to the fatal attack, according to Click2 Houston.
>
> The Houston Police Department has released a composite drawing of the suspect in the killing, described by witnesses as a 5’11” tall African American male in his 20’s or 30’s with a muscular physique.  No motive has been announced for the murder as of this writing.
>
> Issues of gender identity, self-naming, and popular misconceptions concerning transgender people are swirling around this story.  The local and regional media, picking up on the misreporting of the Houston Police as to the gender identity of the victim, have mis-identified Ms. Davis as a “man.”  For years, Ms. Davis chose to identify herself as a female, and lived her life accordingly.
>
> Police were calling her a sex worker.  Most news stories reflect the none-too-sublte bias of law enforcement officers and media professionals, that the life choices, dress, and habits of the victim somehow explain why and how this crime happened.  The transphobia embedded in the culture often comes to the fore in such critical moments, when the character and legitimacy of whole populations of trans people are called into question by the dominant culture.
>
> Ms. Davis was described by local merchants as “respectful,””nice,” and “courteous.”  There are no leads to the whereabouts of her killer as yet but according to ABC News 13, a $5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the suspect has been posted as an incentive to the public.  A memorial of fresh-cut flowers and rainbow flags was placed near the site of “Miss Nate Nate’s” murder on Tuesday, thanks to the leadership of Cristan Williams, local activist.
