Mailda dos Santos (Maria do Bairro),25,,,,8-Jun-2011,tgeu/8-Jun-2011/Mailda dos Santos (Maria do Bairro),"Lagoa Encantada, Cuiaba",Mato Grosso,Brazil,-15.57432,-56.08663,violence,beaten,"Mailda's body was found by a student who called the police.

The circumstances of her murder are reported to have been similar to the murder of [Alicinha da Cruz](https://tdor.translivesmatter.info/reports/2011/05/28/alicinha-da-cruz_tres-lagoas-cuiaba-mato-grosso-brazil_216a97d2), which took place on 28th May 2011 in the same area of Cuiaba.

On 31st June 2020, four men were killed in a confrontation with Military Police. One of them was suspected to have been responsible for the murder of both Mailda and Alicinha.

> One of the four killed in confrontation with the Mobile Tactical Ostensive Rounds Battalion (Rotam), yesterday afternoon (31) on MT-351, in Estrada de Manso, Cleberson Rodrigo, 33, was arrested in September 2011, by the Civil Police, for involvement in the homicide of two [trans women] due to drug debt. At the time he was 23 years old, and was known for trafficking in the CPA region. The investigations pointed out that debt was not the only motivation for the crimes, ""but it is as if these people were going to the chase, expressing a prejudice existing in them, hence the explanation for the torture and cruelty of the crimes"", says an excerpt from the complaint.

The body of the first victim, [deadname] da Cruz, 19, was found on May 28 of that year, inside a stream, on the border bridge of the Três Lagoas neighborhood with Vila Rosa, in Cuiabá, asphyxiated with a rope. Ten days later, on June 8, the [trans woman] Mailda dos Santos Silva, 33, was murdered in a similarly cruel fashion. Her body was found in the CPA III neighborhood, at the back of Lagoa Encantada.
