Yella Clark,45,,,,2-Apr-2024,tgeu/tdor2024/2-Apr-2024/Yella (Robert) Clark Jr.,Louisiana State Penitentiary,,Angola,Louisiana,USA,30.9406437,-91.5709816,custodial,killed In custody,"Yella died after an altercation with three other inmates.

> Yella, a 45-year-old Black transgender person, who was serving a life sentence at Angola prison in Louisiana, was killed in a fight with several other inmates on April 2, 2024. Their death is at least the 16th violent killing of a transgender or gender expansive person HRC has learned of in 2024, and the fifth to be killed in the month of April alone. We say “at least” because too often these deaths go unreported — or misreported. The Human Rights Campaign is deeply saddened to report on Yella’s passing.
>
> With Yella, misreporting and misgendering in initial reports led to delays in HRC’s own reporting. Most articles referred to them with their birth name and sex assigned at birth, though evidence suggests Clark may have used both Yella and Robert (their birth name) in prison. They identified as transgender, had been diagnosed with gender dysphoria, and had begun taking female hormones to physically transition while incarcerated. We do not know which pronouns they used, or which name they preferred, but we will be using Yella and they/them pronouns throughout the rest of this blog.

> A former fellow inmate said that Clark’s [gender identity] was something that made life more dangerous for Clark at Angola.
>
> ""You can be a target,"" they said. ""That kind of thing can make things a little bit more dangerous for you.""
>
> The 2015 United States Transgender Survey found that transgender prisoners are five times more likely to be sexually assaulted by facility staff and over nine times more likely to be sexually assaulted by other inmates. 

Yella was in Angola on a murder conviction which they were trying to have overturned. In an appeals court filing, they argued they were defending themselves from being raped and the killing was in self-defense.

>
> In testimony, the man confessed to the crime.

After they died on their university campus the university was criticised for not looking after the mental health of students.

> Basil Brown was a magnetic person. [Their] presence filled the room and could even make the biggest Debbie Downer smile.
> 
> It's what [their] friends and those who knew [them] remember most about the University of Louisiana at Lafayette student who died by suicide last week.
> 
> Those who interacted with Brown have only been able to recall positive experiences with the 22-year-old, said Malek Richard, who knew Brown through the UL band program.
> 
> Brown always “spoke up for the little guy,” Richard said, and was an advocate for the LGBTQ+ and disability communities.
> 
> Brown shined creatively. [They were] the “clarinet player with the fire fits,” a fellow band member told Richard about Brown and the outfits [they] would wear. [They] combined [their] knowledge of coding with his artistic eye to code a unique universe to life. It was [their] pride and joy. 
> 
> But Brown’s friends have said they’ve barely had time to grieve. They’ve criticized the university for its handling of Brown’s death claiming it wasn’t transparent after Brown’s death leading to misinformation and more pain.
> 
> A group of about 200 students, staff and others gathered Monday afternoon near the UL student union to call on the university to change its welfare check protocol, update its emergency notification system, publicly acknowledge Brown's death and better staff its wellness center with more certified mental health personnel. 
> 
> Had the system been different, if it were better structured to support those struggling, Brown’s friends said they wouldn’t have to shoulder the responsibility to call for change.
> 
> “If (Basil) had been taken care of properly, Basil wouldn’t be in the place [they were] in,” Richard said. “When someone is (in that) situation, they’re not thinking rationally. There has to be someone to make the grand decision of ‘what do you need right now?’ instead of ‘what do you want?’”

*[Editor's Note: Afsana's gender identity is unconfirmed but they appear to have been a trans woman.]*

> New Delhi- In Sultanpuri, Delhi, a transgender [person] involved in a relationship with a woman attempted suicide on April 11th by jumping into a nearby drain, reportedly due to mental distress triggered by [their] partner's suspected affair.
> 
> The trans person, whose name is said to be Afsana, used to work as a hairdresser in a local salon. [Their] friend Kartik told the local media that they had talked just a day before the suicide, asking him to meet up.
> 
> “I assumed [they were] calling me because of a fight between [them] and [their] partner,” stated Kartik.
> 
> The friend continued, “[They were] beaten up by [their] partner and the person he was having an affair with, but things had been sorted out.”
> 
> After learning about the suicide through another friend of theirs, Kartik then collected all the people they knew and reached Sultanpuri, where [they] and [their] partner named Chanchal used to live together in a rented apartment.
> 
> The deceased's parents stated that they went to the police station on the night of the incident and again the next morning. On both occasions, they were dismissed, and no complaint was filed.
> 
> Afsana and Chanchal were in a relationship for 8 years and have been legally married for three. Their marriage was registered in court, as per locals.
> 
> According to the mother of the deceased, the body had multiple injury marks, including a black eye, which points towards physical assault.
> 
> With a trembling voice, she said, “I had warned [them] before, but [they] did not pay any heed to my words.”
> 
> Afsana’s sister alleged that the recent violence had pushed [them] to take the dire step.
> 
> The sister recounted the chilling incident, describing how when locals informed the family that Afsana had jumped into a drain, they rushed to the scene. [Theiir] father bravely leaped in to rescue [them], while nearby women joined together to tie their dupattas into a makeshift rope, attempting to provide support, but unfortunately, their efforts were unsuccessful.
> 
> The Mooknayak attempted to reach out to Sultanpuri Police Station to inquire why an FIR was not lodged despite the family's complaint, but their call went unanswered.
> 
> Afsana's tragic fate is not an isolated incident, and regrettably, she won't be the last victim. Many transgender individuals have been lost to violence and discrimination. Unfortunately, a significant hurdle our nation faces is the absence of real-time data on sexual minorities, including transgender individuals.

Her assilants were two men who had only shortly before been seen with them.

Breno Fernandes Silva, 23, was arrested for murder and attempted murder.

> Although I would only like to have publications celebrating local artists and culture, I also sadly need to bring to light the reality around me and it is horrendous, unfair, disgusting and practically impossible to digest. I recently received news that yet another trans woman was hatefully killed. Whenever this type of story appears in the eyes of laymen, relativization begins. “But what was she doing that night? What clothes was she wearing? Wasn't she the one who looked for it? Wasn’t she on drugs?” They always look for ways to blame the victim and minimize the case, even more so if she is not a cisgender, white or rich person, and as a desperate act of trying to put your perspective, dear reader, on the reality of victims in Brazil, I will describe between facts and comments what happened to Daniele Miranda Alves, a trans woman who was just 21 years old when she entered national longevity statistics for LGBTQIA+ bodies.
> 
> It was a hot Saturday night and Daniele, in the prime of her youth, went out with a friend, Rafhaelly. They went to a dance in the South Zone of São Paulo. They spent the night enjoying the party like anyone their age. At dawn a tragic nightmare began, present in the reality of any trans woman: through images from security cameras we see Daniele being approached by a man. It's a classic flirtation scene between young people. Then, at 6:41 am, a car appears. She gets into the vehicle. For an unknown reason we see that, two minutes later, she leaves the car with a completely different energy. She and her friend are angry, walking back and forth, pointing in the direction of men who are close to the car, a red Volkswagen. They are in public. But, for reasons that everyone imagines, they are practically alone in trying to make a verbal complaint. Only one other woman tries to join the discussion. She pushes Dani into the arms of a man, perhaps in an attempt to make her resolve something with him. We then see Daniele slap a boy and shortly after this a man in a red sweatshirt advances, leading Rafhaelly to physically attack him.
> 
> From that moment on, everything gets worse: everyone who was nearby moves away. Rafhaelly is beaten by the man in the sweatshirt and after Daniele gets out of the car, he goes towards her and attacks her too. After some men enter, the car quickly reverses, almost running over some people. Although the car has left the scene, the two are still there being beaten by the same person, the same monster. The most disgusting thing is knowing that, as shown in the video, the driver of the car, before any argument began, was kissing and hugging Daniele...
> 
> It's natural to think about what exactly caused this argument but I hope you didn't do what I mentioned above. I hope you didn't relativize, look for possible reasons for such a sadistic act. What I can tell readers who have never experienced the reality of a trans woman up close is that this scene is not rare. Unfortunately, the transphobic system swallows and reaps the trans and transvestite community through harassment, sexual and moral aggression combined with constant abuse in the most grotesque ways and this was yet another case that contributes to Brazil being the country that kills and commits the most crimes. of hate towards the LGBTQIA+ population in the world.
> 
> As if Dani and Rafha's pleasant moment of relaxation wasn't enough to end there, the violence didn't stop. I would say that in that footage we only saw the beginning. After receiving punches in broad daylight with no one to defend them, the two return home on foot, where they are surprised on the avenue, 800 meters ahead, with gunfire. Before the crime takes place, we see Rafhaelly looking back in fright, turning her body and realizing that the same car, linked to the attackers, was chasing them and it was too late as they were already approaching. She pushes her friend in an attempt to help her escape. In a fraction of a second we see each one run to one side while shots are fired towards both of them. Rafhaelly realizes that the two have missed each other and also sees that her friend was hit, so she goes back to meet her. The two see each other in a parking lot and also with security cameras we see Daniele still able to walk with the adrenaline running through her veins. But there is no adrenaline that can save her. Daniele falls dead. The red car, the red sweatshirt now makes room for blood running down the streets and dirtying the hands of a criminal. Another trans woman murdered. Another young life cut short by systematic and brutal hatred.

> On April 14 in the Treviño neighborhood in the city of Monterrey, Nuevo León, in northern Mexico, a fire was reported in a neighborhood. According to information from local media , firefighters and civil protection personnel put out the fire and found the charred bodies of two people: that of a man and a trans woman.
> 
> According to Sylvia Pérez, activist and member of the Trans Monterrey Collective, the woman's name was Alison, she rented that room, she did sex work and she was 35 years old.
> 
> Until now, the Nuevo León State Prosecutor's Office has not reported the incident. In local press reports it was reported that personnel from the State Investigation Agency interviewed neighbors and the landlord and are looking for security cameras to identify those responsible. In the notes it emerged that “armed men in a vehicle arrived at Alison's home and set it on fire.”
> 
> This is a “collateral transfeminicide” crime, explains Sylvia Pérez. That is to say, “it apparently happened as a settling of accounts because the man was beheaded, but there are traces of violence against her which indicates that it is also a femicide due to transphobia,” explains the activist.
> 
> “Something we also noticed is that the media criminalized and revictimized Alison. They let it be seen as just another execution, they don't even mention that it is a femicide where there was hatred, cruelty,” she adds.
> 
> On the afternoon of April 16, activists called for a protest at the Prosecutor's Office to demand that it be investigated with a gender and human rights perspective.

Gregory Gilbert, 53, was arrested hours later and faces charges of second degree murder.

> Andrea Doria Dos Passos, 37, a transgender woman who was experiencing homelessness, was found beaten to death Tuesday outside the Miami City Ballet building in Miami Beach, Fla.
> 
> The attack on Dos Passos was caught on surveillance video and led to the arrest of Gregory Fitzgerald Gibert, 53, who is charged with second-degree murder, the Miami Herald reports.
> 
> An employee of the ballet company found Dos Passos lying on the ground about 7 a.m. Tuesday. The worker initially thought she was sleeping, then saw that she was surrounded by blood and called police.
> 
> Surveillance video showed a man beating her with a pipe, and police matched the description to Gibert, who was on probation on charges including aggravated assault with no intent to kill and attempted robbery with a weapon. He had been sentenced to four years of probation on the charges just six days before the attack on Dos Passos.
> 
> Police said they do not consider Dos Passos’s death a hate crime, but some are calling for prosecutors to add a hate-crime enhancement to the charges against Gibert. “We have no evidence indicating that she was targeted solely based on her sexuality and/or gender,” Officer Christopher Bess, a police spokesman, told the Herald.

Andrea had transitioned in October 2023. According to Andrea's grandfather she struggled with mental illness and had been homeless for some time.

A memorial for Andrea was held outside Pridelines’ Miami Beach location at 1130 Washington Avenue shortly after her killing.

Three days earlier [Macarena](https://tdor.translivesmatter.info/reports/2024/04/21/macarena_cali-valle-del-cauca-colombia_b41e298f) had also been murdered in Valle del Cauca.

> April 24, 2024. In the early hours of today, the lifeless body of Sharon Muñoz Zúñiga was found in the municipality of Yumbo, Valle del Cauca. This tragic event marks a dark chapter in the growing wave of violence against trans people in the country. Sharon becomes the fourth victim, joining three other recent cases: Verónica Dantez, affectionately known as La Gringuita in Bogotá, Valentina in the department of Pasto and Macarena/Selena Acuña in Cali. It is alarming to note that this would be the second murder of a trans woman in Valle del Cauca in less than 96 hours.
> 
> This new case of homicide and/or feminicide adds a total of thirteen (13) victims known to the Caribbean Affirmative Observatory. For this reason, Caribe Afirmativo expresses its deep concern about this act of violence, which threatens the integrity and life of LGBTIQ+ people. We demand an immediate and decisive response from the Colombian State and its institutions in the face of these worrying events. It is imperative that justice be done for Sharon Muñoz Zúñiga and for all trans people who have been victims of violence and discrimination in our country, with the application of a differential approach in the investigation and application of the guidelines of Directives 004 and 006 of the Attorney General's Office regarding the type of feminicide and investigations of violence committed against LGBTIQ+ people.
> 
> In addition to the search for justice, it is essential to guarantee the safety and well-being of trans people throughout the national territory. For this reason, we call on the Ministry of the Interior and the LGBTIQ+ Directorate attached to the Ministry of Equality to convene a month of urgent cases, as well as the Government of Valle to convene a working group with civil society and build actions to guarantee the life and personal integrity of LBTIQ+ people. We demand the taking of concrete and effective measures to protect the human rights of all trans people in Colombia and to eradicate the violence and discrimination they face daily.
> 
> As a society, we must unite in solidarity and action to build a country where all people can live a dignified and full life, free of violence and discrimination. We will not rest until we achieve a Colombia where diversity is celebrated and where all lives matter.
> 
> We sympathize with family and friends of Sharon Muñoz Zúñiga in this case, hoping that what happened will be investigated.

> Some to require a haircut and others poorly thought out pointed out that several of them arrived smelling of marijuana, so they do not rule out the possibility that drugs were sold there. 
> 
> The body that was not visible to the public was lifted and taken to the local Forensic Medical Service to perform the tests required under the law. While outside the aesthetics, family and friends lamented the violent death of “La Yuli.”
> 
> Another version claims that it was not just one gunman but three who murdered the stylist.
> 
> Given this, authorities of the Attorney General's Office of the State of Mexico are investigating whether this unfortunate transfemicide was a direct attack or related to a possible crime of extortion.

> All available information regarding Allister's passing contains his deadname so I will not link it, he deserves so much more than that. I do not wish to receive credit for bringing this to your attention, but these were beautiful words from his best friend regarding who Allister was. ""There are so many things that I could tell the world about Allister Matthews. I could tell you how he was never afraid to be himself. I could tell you how unapologetically unique he was from the way he dressed to the way he spoke. I could tell you how he had freckles on his cheeks and the bridge of his nose like little stars that I'd give tiny kisses to just to see him smile. I could tell you how he saw value in every life, no matter how small.""
