>
> This is important to me because I've got congenital heart disease, autism, bipolar, ADHD, borderline personality disorder, schizoaffective, and gender dysphoria. I've got medical bills that I can't afford to pay that just keep adding up and affecting my credit. I've no job or income disability has been denying me for the last 7 years and now I'm homeless.
>
> I would like to get a cheap vehicle to live out of so that im not on the streets and have transportation to look for work. Every little bit helps me pay my medical debt off & get a used vehicle.

A celebration of her life was held on 19th October.

Her mum said the following about Aoife:

> ""Aoife left this physical world at the young age of 27. A deep thinker and wise beyond her years, she had such a beautiful soul. She loved everyone from all walks of life, and had such a big heart with a brilliant mind and never-ending imagination. Everywhere she went, she made friends. She loved to put fun outfits together and wear Lennon glasses and elf ears. She loved all kinds of activities, especially playing video and role-playing games, longboarding, and outdoor things like fishing, camping, and going for hikes, Aoife loved being in nature and enjoyed going up City Creek for walks with her friends. She is greatly missed.""

> Kesaria Abramidze, a well-known Georgian transgender woman, 37, was found brutally murdered in her apartment on the night of September 18. The Ministry of Internal Affairs has arrested her boyfriend, Beka Jaiani, the next morning as the suspected killer.
> 
> The case is being investigated under Article 109 of the Criminal Code, for premeditated murder with aggravating circumstances of special cruelty based on gender identity. The victim reportedly suffered multiple stab wounds. The suspect faces 16 to 20 years or life imprisonment.
> 
> Reports indicate that about two hours before the murder, Kesaria Abramidze posted a photo of herself and her boyfriend on her Facebook story. This has led to speculations that the photo may have triggered the crime, as her boyfriend allegedly did not want it to be made public.
> 
> Neighbors and friends of the victim describe a toxic relationship between Kesaria Abramidze and Beka Jaiani with reports of constant physical and psychological abuse. At one point, she had to leave the country due to persistent manipulation and violence, which she discussed in a post from April this year. It appears that relevant law enforcement authorities did not adequately address her concerns.

Kesaria's murder came a day after the Georgian Parliament passed anti-LGBT legislation. The murder caused so much outrage in the country that the Georgian president, Salome Zourabichvili attended her funeral.

It remains to be seen whether the legislation will remain on the statute books.

> The news came just one day after Georgia’s Parliament passed a controversial anti-LGBT legislation, which stigmatizes the community and restricts their freedom of expression and assembly. But the government’s anti-LGBT rhetoric goes back much further.
> 
> “There is a direct correlation between the use of hate speech in politics and hate crimes,” Social Justice Center (SJC), a human rights watchdog, said in its statement reacting to the murder. “It has been almost a year that the Georgian Dream government has been aggressively using homo/bi/transphobic language and cultivating it with mass propaganda means,” the SJC adds.
> 
> “It is certain that the policy of hate has serious consequences – harassment of LGBTI people, their marginalization and violence against them. The case of the murder of Kesaria Abramidze cannot be perceived without this general context,” the SJC says.
> 
> The watchdog calls on the Georgian MIA and the Prosecutor’s Office to investigate whether the crime was motivated by hate, in particular transphobia, and whether the murder was preceded by previous acts of violence, as well as whether the Georgian MIA and the Prosecutor’s Office responded adequately to them.
> 
> Michael Roth, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the German Bundestag, who visited Georgia two days ago, also reacted to the case: “Kesaria Abramidze was killed. Just one day after the Georgian parliament passed the anti-LGBTI law. I am deeply shocked and call on the ruling party “Georgian Nightmare” to immediately withdraw the shameful law.”

> HYDERABAD: An HIV-positive transgender person died on Saturday night in the Liaquat University Hospital (LUH) for want of, what her colleagues claimed, 'timely attention' by the hospital administration.
>
> According to transgender rights activist [deadname], Nirma, 24, was admitted to the LUH in Jamshoro last week for a surgery as she had some wound on her hip. She said the wound developed some infection but doctors did not allow the surgical procedure and she was discharged.

> Sana said that Nirma had been an HIV-positive patient for the last four years and after remaining at home for the last couple of days, her condition deteriorated. ""We shifted her to the LUH city branch on Saturday where doctors didn't pay attention to her and she died in medical unit-II,"" she claimed.
>
> She said Nirma needed intensive care unit (ICU) where bed was not available for her. According to Mariam, a transgender community leader, doctors said that since she was an HIV-positive patient, they would not touch her. ""It is a case of sheer gender discrimination,"" she alleged.
>
> LUH Resident Medical Officer (RMO) Dr Faizan said an ICU bed was arranged for the patient and it was allotted to her.
Dr Faizan also explained that patient was in a state of gasping when received at the casualty department at around 6.30pm on Saturday with complaint of abscess. ""The patient was taking hormonal therapy [for breast development) and abscess was developed in gluteal region due to administration of wrong injections.

> He said that she was also an HIV-positive and was given emergency treatment at casualty ward before being referred to medicine unit. He said that at around 10:30pm, one bed had fallen vacant in the ICU at LUH, Jamshoro, and her attendants were advised to move to Jamshoro. However, he said, they initially refused and agreed to move only after one hour of counselling.

Two of these people were later captured.”

> “Perhaps it is a complacency, which I have denounced, on the part of the police and intolerance on the part of the community in general. Let us remember that the call for “social cleansing” is serious because it is the systematic killing of people with the complacency of the civilian population. If you look at the comments on social networks or go out on the street, many people agree with the killing of homeless people and I think this is very worrying,” said the lawyer.

> He also indicated that there is fear among some homeless people due to the increase in violent deaths of these people that has been recorded in Cúcuta.
