> 
> According to the version handled by Grecia O'hara, a trans activist from the organization Center for LGBTI Development and Cooperation, Kopola was with another person in the room, with whom the victim had argued prior to the criminal act.

>

After IBM fired her for advising them of her intention to transition in 1968, she transitioned, started a new career and, with Carver Mead, wrote the book *[Introduction to VLSI systems](https://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/conway/VLSI/VLSIText/PP-V2/V2.pdf)* in 1978. This led to what is now known as the *[Mead-Conway VLSI chip design revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mead%E2%80%93Conway_VLSI_chip_design_revolution)*.

After Lynn retired in 1999 she came out publicly and became one of the most visible trans people in the USA. Her empathy, creativity, strength and leadership made her a role model for many trans people worldwide. *[including myself - when I came out in 2001, Lynn was one of my role models - Editor]*

> Lynn Ann Conway was an electrical engineer, computer scientist, and an activist on behalf of transgender people. She died in Jackson, Michigan on Sunday, June 9, 2024 of heart trouble.
>
> Lynn was born in Mount Vernon, New York on January 2, 1938. She was a reserved but exceptionally bright student who attended MIT but did not graduate due [to] a difficult and ultimately unsuccessful gender transition. Conway continued education at Columbia University, where she earned B.S. and M.S.E.E. degrees in 1962 and 1963, respectively. In 1964, Conway accepted a position as a researcher at IBM’s facility in Yorktown Heights, New York. There, Conway worked with others on an advanced supercomputer project. Conway was fired in 1968 when it became known that she intended to transition. IBM later apologized for that action.
>
> That same year, Lynn consulted Dr. Harry Benjamin and became a patient. She completed her gender transition, also in 1968. In a divorce, she was denied the right to visit with her minor children.
>
> Using her new name, Lynn continued work as a computer research scientist, working at Computer Applications, Inc., Memorex, and, Xerox PARC, and DARPA. In 1985, she became a professor of electrical engineering and computer science at the University of Michigan and, simultaneously, Associate Dean of Engineering.
>
> Lynn’s post-transition accomplishments were foundational in the [development] of computers, but her pre-transition work was not credited to her until 1998, when a researcher who was examining IBM’s three-decades old supercomputer project discovered that a scientist he had been unable to identify had become known as Lynn Conway. For Lynn, this resulted in a difficult decision to come out as transgender. She has since been hailed not only for her myriad post-transition accomplishments, but for her earlier work. She is famous for, among many other things, launching the Mead-Conway VLSI chip design revolution.
>
> Lynn was well-known in transgender circles for her accomplishments and for her website, on which she told her personal story and worked to advance the rights of transgender people. She is perhaps best known in this regard for her criticism of Ray Blanchard’s theory of autogynephilia and a failed lawsuit, with Dierdre McCloskey, against J. Michael Bailey author of The Man Who Would be Queen. 
>
> In 2002, Lynn married her long-time boyfriend Charles Rogers. They lived on a 24-acre wooded property in rural Michigan.

![The homepage of Lynn's website](https://tdor.translivesmatter.info/data/photos/2024_06_09_Lynn-Conway_website.png)

Even if one were to ignore Lynn's technical achievements, the contents of [her website](http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/conway/) alone were enormously impactful at the beginning of the 21st century, containing as it does not only many detailed resources for trans people, but also gallery/biography pages (*""[Transsexual Women's Successes](https://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/conway/TSsuccesses/TSsuccesses.html)"" and ""[Successful TransMen: Links and Photos](https://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/conway/TSsuccesses/TransMen.html)""*) which for the first time illustrated the breadth, variety and creativity of our community.

In a world before social media, that alone was incredibly impactful as the contents of such pages directly challenged the media stereotypes of trans people prevalent at the time.

The circumstances suggest her death may have been a ""suicide by cop"".

> Two weeks after Denver Police shot and killed 52-year-old [deadname] Tapia, who was threatening officers with a knife, investigators know little more than Tapia's name and age.
> 
> “I do want to acknowledge the tragedy of the death,” said Denver Police Chief Ron Thomas at a press briefing Tuesday. “And also our significant regret at the fact that despite significant efforts to try to identify next of kin, we've not been able to make a family notification as we would've liked and so those efforts will continue.”
> 
> Tapia, a trans woman, spoke Spanish, at one point telling the officers something.“I think translated to mean ‘kill me,’” according to Thomas. 
> 
> “I don’t think that we’ll ever know what their desire was in that situation,” said Thomas, who referred to Tapia using they/them pronouns. “But certainly the presence of the knife, the proximity that that individual got to those officers with the knife, I think makes their response appropriate.”
> 
> A timeline of the shooting
>
> At around 11:30 a.m. on Sunday, June 16, reports came in to police about a person blocking traffic in the area of Broadway and Lawrence Street. A Denver Park Ranger at the scene called police at 11:45 a.m., reporting that the person was armed with an 8-inch knife and refusing to get out of the road. Officers quickly responded and found Tapia, and positioned their patrol cars to divert traffic.
> 
> The encounter, captured on body camera, lasted only seconds. One officer told Tapia to put their hands on their head at least three times. Tapia then pulled out a large knife from a bag and advanced quickly towards the officer. A second officer gave commands in Spanish.
> 
> Two officers deployed their Tasers. One of the officers deployed his Taser twice.
> 
> As Tapia got closer with the knife drawn, both officers opened fire — 12 shots in all, and Tapia fell motionless into the street. Police rendered aid to Tapia after the shooting, and an ambulance arrived quickly, but Tapia was pronounced dead at the scene.

She had been there at least a week.

An autopsy is awaited, but the circumstances under which her body was found suggest a homicide.

> On July 6, the body of a trans woman in an advanced state of decomposition was found inside the pine forest of Castel Fusano in Ostia. Her name was Lucero Rodriguez Valdivia, she was 48 years old and came from Peru . In Italy for over 10 years and with a regular residence permit, she worked as a sex worker right inside that thicket on the Roman coast where she was found. Her body remained in the undergrowth for at least a week, maybe ten days. Her friends and family are now wondering, is it possible that no one looked for her before?
> 
> According to the story of Lucero's friends (also sex workers), there had to be a driver, hired to take them to the pine forest and then take them home, since that is an area not served by public transport. Could he have seen something? We do not know if the man was tracked down and interviewed by the police, but according to those who worked with the victim, he could have valuable information on the matter.
> 
> ""We are talking about a hate crime,"" says Asia Cione, spokesperson and activist for the Libellula Italia ATS association, "" regardless of the cause of death. Those who knew Lucero think she was killed, but even if it was a sudden illness, we are talking about a person left for days and days thrown in the undergrowth without anyone looking for her or helping her in any way. Trans people are always treated like second-class citizens, even when they die.""
> 
> Yesterday, an autopsy was ordered on Lucero's body at the Institute of Forensic Medicine of the University Hospital of Rome Tor Vergata. A fundamental test to understand the cause of death, since no obvious signs of violence were found on his body. ""At the moment we are not excluding any possibility,"" the investigators continue to repeat half-heartedly.
> 
> In the meantime, Pamela Rodríguez, Lucero's sister, arrived in Rome from Germany yesterday after hearing the tragic news. She too was interviewed by the Carabinieri and is still very shocked by what happened. ""What happened to my sister is inhuman, no one deserves to die like this and be forgotten like an old rag thrown in a corner,"" Pamela told us shortly after her arrival in Italy. "" those who haven't spoken can still make up for it and come forward to tell what happened to my sister, please tell me what they did to her.""
