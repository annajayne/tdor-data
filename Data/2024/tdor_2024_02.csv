After her memorial service, disparaging remarks made by the New York Archdiocese about her funeral sparked public outrage.

In September 2024 Michael Kuilan, 44, and Antonio Venti, 52, pled guilty to distributing the heroin and fentanyl that caused her death.

> In February, friends and family gathered to mourn the unexpected death of beloved trans activist, Cecilia Gentili. This month two people have been charged Monday for allegedly 
> 
> Text messages, cell site data, and other evidence showed that 52-year-old Antonio Venti of Long Island sold Gentili drugs on Feb. 5, and Brooklyn resident, Michael Kuilan, 44, supplied Venti with the deadly narcotics, federal prosecutors said. Law enforcement officials searching Kuilan’s home also found hundreds of baggies of fentanyl, a handgun and ammunition, according to Breon Peace, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York.
> 
> Her death at age 52 drew significant attention. Cecilia, an Argentinian immigrant, was a renowned activist, advocating for immigrants, the transgender community, sex worker rights and people living with HIV.
> 
> Controversy around her funeral at St. Patrick’s Cathedral sparked outrage from the New York Archdiocese, which called the funeral “sacrilegious and deceptive.” Apparently, the diocese didn’t do a background check to determine if Cecilia deserved to be honored in this space. Even in death, she was a powerful advocate for visibility and acknowledgment.
> 
> “Cecilia’s immaculate work and the way she touched so many hearts and lives made her worthy of sainthood. Cecilia deserved this historic honor of the monumental funeral service at St. Patrick’s Cathedral, and to be cemented in history as a mother of multiple movements –– of sex worker, immigration, trans, and affirming health care movements,” said Oscar Diaz, the director of communications at Trans Equity Consulting, an organization that Gentili founded. “Her wit, creativity, humor, and grace will be missed by the generations she mothered.”
> 
> Cecilia was born on Jan. 31, 1972, in Gálvez, a city in northeastern Argentina. She eventually made her way to the United States and experienced multiple levels of dehumanizing oppression in her struggle to survive. You can read the full news obituary at them and the New York Times I cannot begin to do justice to this woman. In 2019, she founded Trans Equity Consulting, a development consulting firm that sought to center that according to them was “paying trans people to be experts on their own experiences.” Her voice gives rise to many other voices, something we should acknowledge by not only seeking justice for her death but listening to trans people.
> 
> She was poisoned. Yes, she was using heroin. But that doesn’t mitigate that these two men allegedly laced the heroin with a known deadly substance. Of course heroin users don’t deserve to be poisoned. She was killed by greedy, vicious, and callous profiteers with no regard for her magnificent life or the lives of the others who bought their tainted drugs. Those whose names, honestly, will not make the NYT or draw ire or an acknowledgment from any Catholic leader. Undoubtedly the people I think Cecilia would be most concerned about – people who suffered at the hands of a hostile world and villainous humans.

> Hello everyone, I am organizing a planned memorial for my sister jade. She was a beautiful free spirited black transwoman who met her end at the hands of intimate partner violence on her own birthday. Jade was the kind of person who the party didn't start until she rolled through.
> 
> Her smile, her laugh, turned a party that was on 10 to 1000. She was never afraid to say hello and put herself out there no matter how mean or scary a person or situation might seem. Many would say ""she was outside"" and our girl was always outside. Doing her best to live life to the fullest.She never let the opinions of people who judged her or mistreated her for being trans stop her from living her life.
> 
> On february 5th 2024 Jade's boyfriend had become unhinged and she was trying to escape the situation. She tried contacting me but because my boyfriend was already spending the night I was unavailable. The next morning she was found dead in her boyfriend's apartment and he could not be located.
> 
> I tried my best to provide the police the evidence of our conversation about her wanting to escape him. The police did not seem to care very much. Seemed to me that Far as they were concerned another black transwoman dead is not a priority.
> 
> The police investigation was in a state of limbo while her body lay in cold storage for ages. Until they randomly decided to close the case and no justice would be found for my sister. Many times when black transwomen are murdered we are seen as bottom of the barrel by society and no one cares what happens to us.
> 
> Which is why this memorial is so important for those to know & remember the amazing woman she was that this cruel world never deserved. I do not want her memory to end with her buried under a dead name she never identified with. These funds will help go towards her being remembered with the dignity and respect she deserves as a beautiful, courageous black transwoman.

Her body was found with gunshot wounds near the Villahermosa-Cárdenas highway.

> MEXICO CITY, Mexico. Elisa Cortez was a 24-year-old trans woman. On Tuesday, February 13, her body was found with gunshot wounds in an area of rancherías on the Villahermosa-Cárdenas highway section, in Tabasco, a state in the southeast of Mexico. Elisa was originally from Tenosique and according to press information she worked as a sex worker. 
> 
> Media outlets that reported the incident did so by revealing her registered name and misgendering her. Activists from Tabasco and other parts of the country claimed this as part of the violence that trans women face. After being murdered, they are revictimized by not recognizing their gender identity and name.
> 
> Tabasco trans activist Alexandra Morales says that Elisa did not have a gender identity change. But in the investigation file for this crime it is being taken into account that she was a trans woman. 
> 
> Hilaria Gutiérrez, consumed by despair and grief, angrily cried out for justice for the death of her daughter, Eli. In the midst of her pain, she claims not to mind losing her life until she finds those who took a piece of her life from her.
> 
> “They didn't just take Eli's life, they killed me. I loved my daughter from the moment I knew she was in my womb, they took her from me, they hurt her, they took away her dreams and at the same time they killed me,” she sobbed, devastated.
> 
> Eli was a trans girl who assumed she was a woman from a very young age. Contrary to other cases, Eli received the support of her mother and her brothers who at all times respected her decision to undergo her transition, without imagining that she would soon tragically leave her side.
> 
> Although Eli provided beauty services to some neighbors in the community where he lived, the money was never enough to cover the expenses, so he decided to dedicate himself to sex services in the center of the city.
> 
> The 23-year-old girl decided to leave for the local capital from Tenosique, far from her mother. Eli lived in silence about traumatic events that had already taken a toll on her life. At the beginning of 2023, she was a victim of kidnapping, after three days of being captive was freed by her captors who claimed to have confused her.
> 
> For Hilaria, justice has become an elusive ghost that seems to mock her and her daughter, refusing to be under the shadow of impunity, promising herself not to rest until she gives her daughter the rest she deserves.

The executioner acted cruelly and left the body in an open field.

> Yesterday, shortly after 1 in the morning, a resident of this place informed the integrated patrol about the occurrence of shots. When the police and security team arrived, they found the body in a vacant lot and there were no personal documents in sight. Around there were only the 380 shell casings of the firearm used to murder this person, who is known as “Abigail.”

Note that initial reports gave her name as ""Evelyn"" and subsequent reports ""Vanessa"". It is possible that she used both names.

> Said woman, between 35 and 40 years old, identified as Evelyn , received several blows, mainly to the face, before she was wounded with a firearm at the level of the abdomen.
> 
> There the female was lying face up on the loose brown sand, a few meters from a goal without a net, painted white and blue, next to a mound of earth and gravel, near the intersection between Luis Méndez and Guelatao avenues.
> 
> Residents of the area who noticed the presence of the body approached her and upon noticing that her arms were already rigid and extended to the sides, they notified the police.
> 
> Near the place of discovery, there are some improvised houses, made with wood, stones and canvas, where apparently said person had lived for a long period of time.
> 
> ""I saw her very calm, she lived there and suddenly she would get involved with her friends. Then she would collect pets and start separating them. She had no problems with anyone,"" commented a woman who approached the place accompanied by two children.

A suspect was arrested in June 2024. Initial investigations suggested that he shot Vanessa because ""she did not want to work for him"".

Her assailant was detained by a security guard and arrested.

> The Court of Justice of Bahia converted Laize de Almeida Silva's arrest into preventative arrest. She was arrested in the early hours of Saturday (24) for stabbing to death a 15-year-old trans girl, who identified herself as Haila Vitória, in Santaluz. The woman underwent a custody hearing this Monday (26) and must be transferred to a prison.
> 
> The Civil Police officially identified the victim as [deadname] Santana de Souza. According to witnesses, Laize was in a bar, accompanied, when she started an argument with the teenager. Around 30 people were at the scene, according to judge Adiane Jaqueline Neves da Silva Oliveira's decision. 
> 
> Haila was stabbed and died instantly. The Military Police were called and arrested the suspect. At the Serrinha Territorial Police Station, Laize claimed self-defense, but, based on videos from security cameras, the judge did not accept that.
> 
> ""It can be seen from the video that Laize went towards [deadname], who pushed her, more than once, gesturing with open arms, as if she were complaining to her. In turn, the suspect, which, it should be noted, is much taller than the victim, she demonstrated disregard for the situation, holding her hair up while the victim questioned something,"" the judge wrote.
> 
> Still in her understanding, ""it was not clear that the suspect committed the crime in self-defense."" The judge also took into account that the suspect faces a crime of bodily harm against an ex-partner. ""It turns out that, in those records, the bailiff was unable to locate her for summons, and the suspension of the process and prescription was ordered, under the terms of article 366, CPP, after having been summoned by notice.""

> ""It's late and it's been a horrible two days. The short version is two nights ago, two members of the Calgary Police Service came to my home and asked to come inside and speak with me, and that's when I learned that my trans nephew had died by suicide.
> 
> ""As a rational person, as a just a person in our world, and also as a family doctor, I sort of figured that there's a reasonable chance that these horrible policies that were unveiled in that disgusting video by Premier Smith probably didn't help.
> 
> ""And yesterday I learned that they not just didn't help, that they were a contributing cause, that my trans nephew had been worried for quite some time and actually had messaged me in the past about concerns about the growing trend case in the United States and in Canada, but that specifically he was very scared and felt quite isolated as a direct result of Premier Danielle Smith unveiling of her planned policies... 
> 
> ""The reason he's dead: Well, it's complex, but a direct contributing factor was the announcement by Premier Smith. And so you said earlier in the show it's only a matter of time before some people die as a result or start to get hurt as a result of her policies that she unveiled.
> 
> ""And my nephew was 37, so not a kid or teen anymore. But still we now have at least one person death, which we can directly draw a line to to Premier Smith and the kind of hate that she and Pierre Poilievre and their ilk are promoting. 


> Earlier this month, Smith announced new rules on transgender and gender identity in Alberta, including directions around naming, sexual education, transgender athletes in women’s sports, and gender-affirming care. If passed, Alberta will require parental consent for students 15 and under who want to change their names or pronouns at school. Students 16 and 17 years old won’t need consent, but their parents will have to be notified.
> 
> Parents must also opt-in for their kids to participate in each class that teaches about sex education, sexual orientation, or gender identity. Current laws allow parents to opt-out of such education.
> 
> Gender reassignment surgery will also be banned for those 17 and under, the premier said, and minors won’t have access to puberty blockers and hormone therapies for gender reassignment or gender affirmation.

> News hunters report that the discovery was made by people who were passing through the area at around 2 pm yesterday, Sunday, who raised the alarm to the residents of the sector and informed the police authorities so that they could come to rule out criminal actions.
> 
> The unfortunate [woman] was part of a group that went out to the streets to earn a living by dancing, and for some time she had fallen into the clutches of liquor and drugs, which is why she began to be rejected by many people, to the point of being seen sleeping on the streets of the municipality.

In the afternoon they gave her a Christian burial.


Subsequently Teresa's family started to receive death threats.

> Contrary to initial reports of suicide, Teresa’s family members have said they have received death threats and have demanded an investigation by the police, given that the way she was found made it impossible for her to have committed suicide,” notes the Observatory , run by the feminist organization La Corriente.

> Members of the Lancaster community left flowers, letters and chalk art in memory of Ash Clatterbuck during a candlelight vigil held at Penn Square in downtown Lancaster on Thursday, Feb. 29, 2024.
> 
> To those who knew him, Ashton Clatterbuck was easy to describe: A magnetic personality with a big laugh and a quick wit. A voracious reader and fast marathon runner. A sharp writer and a tireless activist who sought out injustice and called for change.
> 
> What is so much harder for his family and friends to explain is how it feels knowing that he is gone: Another transgender person who sought acceptance and died far too young.
> 
> “He has touched so many lives for good in his short life,” said his mother, [name redacted]. “I cannot express how much our hearts hurt. His smile was contagious, and his positivity brought sunlight to so many hurting.”
> 
> “Ash was an incredible human being who made all of our lives brighter by virtue of knowing him. May his memory be a blessing.” said Democratic state Rep. Izzy Smith Wade-El, who represents Lancaster and led the vigil [for Ash].
> 
> After the vigil, the sounds of crying and whispering gave way to conversation, a violin and even some laughter as people found fellowship in one another. Some knew Clatterbuck personally. Others, like Deklan Rupp of Lancaster, came to give support to a transgender community that he said simply wants to be accepted but is instead met with endless scrutiny and vilification — in the news, in politics and at school board meetings.
> 
> “It was very moving, just to see how many people were there, just to see how many people’s lives were touched by Ash,” said Rupp. Rupp, a transgender man who serves as music minister at Vision of Hope Metropolitan Community Church in Mountville, said it’s important for transgender people “to show up and make ourselves seen.”
> 
> Rupp said he was stunned to realize that this is the third young transgender person that he knows of who has died in Lancaster County in the last year. Theodora “Thea” Cassidy of Ephrata and River Olmsted of Manheim Township died last fall, just weeks apart.
>
> Rupp said there is an urgent need for young transgender people to feel accepted — and know where to turn when they need help navigating gender identity, family and the stresses of being targeted by politicians and activist groups.
> 
> The morning after the vigil, Lititz Chooses Love executive director Parker Webb was already busy planning events to help others in the LGBTQ+ community who are struggling with grief and sadness. “During this difficult time in our community, coming together in love and joy can be healing,” Webb said. Online, he directed people to three upcoming events hosted by Lititz Chooses Love: Karaoke, coffee and a meeting for adults.
>
> “We just are in an emergency situation,” said Webb. “And we want to work with others. If you want to work with our community, we’re here. We need places where queer people feel welcome.”
> 
> Chriss Nelson, a Clay Township resident who identifies as nonbinary and is president and founder of Trans Minors Rights, worked with Ash Clatterbuck at an arts and crafts meetup a year ago. “There were so many people (at Thursday’s vigil). I wasn’t expecting that. Ash touched the lives of so many people,” Nelson said. “The work that he did and his family did was so amazing. It’s going to live on. It was such an inspiration. It was such a privilege to meet such a compassionate person.”
> 
> “The political climate has just been really dangerous recently,” Nelson said. “People seem to be encouraging violence. The story about Nex (Benedict) that broke recently was just an example of that, of how angry, I think, people have become. So I think it’s important to keep educating people, and pushing for legislation that protects people.”
> 
> Nelson said they were shaken by Clatterbuck's death. “The political climate has become so much more dangerous that even having a supportive family isn’t enough anymore. It's really scary that politicians are using their platforms to do something so detrimental to our community.”
> 
> Clatterbuck himself pointed to this problem, though, as his father put it, his son’s approach was not based in anger. Mark Clatterbuck recounted that his son took him to a “ReAwaken America” event at Spooky Nook in October 2022. He wanted to give people a chance to meet a transgender person.
> 
> There, Ash Clatterbuck stood in line to shake the hand of Michael Flynn, the conspiracy theorist and a national security adviser during the Trump administration. “It was that kind of playful, subversive way that he confronted hatred,” Mark Clatterbuck said.
> 
> As a writer and occasional contributor to the LNP | LancasterOnline opinion section, Ash Clatterbuck took on a range of issues facing LGBTQ+ people. “Making it ‘illegal’ to be transgender does not stop people from being born transgender,” he wrote last May. “Closing your eyes doesn’t make us go away. The anti-LGBTQ+ political stunts we see around the country — masquerading as religious liberty and moral piety — are doing real harm to queer Americans.”
> 
> In that piece, Chatterbuck pointed to a study by Williams Institute on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Law and Public Policy at UCLA that found about 1.5% of Americans identify as transgender. “This makes for an easy target, and the GOP knows this,” Clatterbuck wrote.
> 
> “America is a country of diversity, inclusion, strength and liberty. How does my very existence challenge, in any way, those values — your values? Your actions cannot change who we are. The only thing you can change is your own attitude toward us.”
> 
> For [his mother], her son will be remembered for more than his work supporting LGBTQ+ rights. “He always sided with and spoke for marginalized people,” she said. Asked what motivated him to care for those in need, she said she remembered sitting together as a family, reciting the Lord’s Prayer and contemplating the Beatitudes, which is part of the New Testament of the Bible.
> 
> She said groups that have been targeting transgender people will probably try to say her son was simply a “tortured soul” — a notion she rejects. “He was not a tortured soul,” she said. “He was a ray of light. If he was tortured, it’s because our culture has created a world in which people like Ash are not welcome.”

> Righteous Torrence ""TK"" Hill (Chevy), a Black transman, 35, was reportedly murdered last week Thursday, February 29, 2024. Artist and LGBT-rights activist Yves Mathieu-East, a friend of Hill, shared the news of his murder via Instagram. Details surrounding his death are limited at this time,
> 
> Loved by many, Hill was an indispensable community leader known for his humility, exceptional talent, and most importantly, his kind heart.

> Originally from Macon, GA, Hill was the founder/owner of Evollusion, an Atlanta-based full-service hair salon dedicated to serving the LGBTQIA+ community specializing in hair, nails, barbering, and makeup. 
> 
> Countering the Black, traditional, barbershop culture that is typically felt as a queerphobic environment, Hill’s salon offered a much-needed safe space for the Black, LGBTQIA+ residents of Atlanta and its surrounding areas. 

TK posted this several days before passing away:
 
> “AS I LAY IN THIS TENT I REALIZE IMMEDIATELY camping is relaxing and I’M NOT the same as I used to be. I’m grown now. I try my best to avoid things taking me back to the old me. MOST importantly I’m still working on myself. Letting people feel like they’ve “won” has helped me drastically [reduce] ignorance and drama in my life! AMAZINGLY I now have time and cognitive focus on my FOCUS! Point is I’m a mature, happy adult & I thank God for the growth.”

> THE Body of [deadname] Uwuseb (35), mostly known as “Queen” by loved ones and friends, was discovered in a decomposed state in a riverbed close to Golgota over the weekend, with close family and friends labeling her death as a hate crime.
> 
> Queen, who is a transgender woman, is a part of the Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender and Queer (LGBTQ) community and was allegedly last seen in the presence of an Aawambo man on Thursday 29 February 2024, in Golgota before her death.
> 
> Friends of Queen recounted the gruesome crime to the informanté’ and added that this is a hate crime, as it was the second murder case involving a member of the LGBTQ community, after a 36-year-old [woman] was also discovered dead on Sunday in Dorado Park in [her] home, robbed of [her] vehicle and furniture.
>
> “I last saw her two weeks back. According to police sources, the murder incident happened on Thursday night; however, the body was only discovered on Sunday. Queen had a nomadic lifestyle and would at times come to stay with me in Khomasdal or stay in Golgota,” Stanley said.
> 
> He added that according to neighbours, Queen went to the Bridge 99 bar, as well as Fantastic bar on Monte Christo road (now called Eneas Nanyemba road) on the day she had been killed. “We just got the news on Sunday; she had left the previous week to Golgota,” Stanley said.
> 
> The friend further said that neighbours spotted Queen walking around with an Aawambo man on Thursday and that the neighbours questioned the unknown man about Queen’s whereabouts when they again saw him on Friday, to which he allegedly just said “Queen is dead.” The neighbours however thought that this was a bad joke and thought nothing of it.
> 
> [They] added that the body was discovered by one of the community members who stay alongside Eneas Nanyemba road, a woman who had gone to relieve herself in the riverbed, but instead stumbled upon the decomposed body of the victim. He added that the neighbours recalled that the suspect had told them that Queen is dead, and thereafter notified the police to track [her] down. [They] added that the suspect was arrested on Sunday, 3 March 2023, on the same day the body was discovered, and that the suspect had been found in possession of a plastic bag which contained the victim’s clothes, as well as had scratches all over his body. The suspect identified as Shafa Amutenya appeared in the Katutura Magistrate court and was remanded in custody, with the case postponed for further investigations.
