> ST. GENEVIEVE, Mo. (First Alert 4) -A transgender woman from St. Louis has been identified as the victim whose body was discovered along the Mississippi River.
> 
> “She was not by herself. She loved herself too much to walk out on that river,” says childhood friend, Izzy Baker.
> 
> The body of 23-year-old Darri Moore’s was recovered after police responded to a call from Tower Rock Stone in St. Genevieve. Employees working along the water found the body on May 1.
>
> Investigators tell First Alert 4, Darri’s body was so badly decomposed the autopsy results could not determine the cause of death. A spokesman says foul play has been ruled out. Detectives are in need of the public’s help to prevent the case from going cold.
> 
> “I just hate that her mother doesn’t have any answers. Her father doesn’t have any answers. Her sister doesn’t have any answers. I don’t have any answers,” says Baker.
> 
> A GoFundMe has been set up for funeral expenses. Baker hopes it raises awareness about the dangers those who identify as transgender face.
> 
> “Somebody knows and they’re not telling us. I just pray and hope that someone comes forward to tell us what happened.”
> 
> Anyone aware of Darri Moore’s whereabouts or who was with Darri leading up to the disappearance is urged to call the St. Genevieve County Sheriff’s Office at (573) 883-5820. Anonymous tips can be made through CrimeStoppers at (866) 371-8477.

She was found naked, horribly mutilated and her clothing was scattered at the scene of her killing. 

The transgender woman was last seen by family members on Wednesday morning when she packed her clothes to visit a friend’s place. Many people believe the country's anti-LGBTQ sentiment from its' leaders are taking a toll on LGBTQ citizens as well.

> Fredricks’ death brings the total number of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning, intersex and other (LGBTQI+) community members murdered in hate crimes in the past year to six, the Namibia Equal Rights Movement claimed yesterday. The Namibian police did not verify this figure, however, there have been several cases since the beginning of this year.
>
> Fredricks’ body was discovered at Otjomuise’s 7de Laan settlement in Windhoek yesterday. The transgender woman was last seen by family members on Wednesday morning when she packed her clothes to visit a friend’s place.
>
> The Namibia Equal Rights Movement blames members of parliament (MPs) and Swapo backbencher Jerry Ekandjo’s private member’s bills – passed by both the National Assembly and National Council – which aim to redefine the term ‘spouse’ and amend the Marriage Act of 1961 to block the recognition of same-sex marriage in Namibia for the undignified killings.
>
> “The undignified killings of LGBTQI+ Namibians is a direct result of the parliament legislating hate and sanctioning hate crimes.
>
> “Since the parliament passed the anti-LGBTQI+ bill in July 2023, we have lost six queer siblings to hate crimes and violent murders. Reports continue to detail victims being tied up, found naked and, in the most recent report, their genitals cut off,” the movement stated yesterday.
>
> Minister of agriculture, water and land reform Calle Schlettwein yesterday said: “I am greatly saddened and concerned about this senseless and brutal behaviour.
>
> Fredricks’ aunt, Beniqna Visser, yesterday received a call from an unknown person, telling her a “[offensive term] was murdered”. “My heart immediately dropped as soon as I received the call, because according to the caller, the deceased was identified as ‘Sexy Charmy’, which is what we call her at home.
>
> “When we got to the scene, we immediately saw her black dress, hair and underwear on the ground,” Visser said. She said the shock has left her in denial and hopeful that Fredricks would still return home.
>
> “So cruel to perform such a gruesome act,” she said.
>
> “I believe this was done by two or more people, because how can someone [mutilate Fredricks’ genitals] and put it on her chest, her body had about 32 stab wounds all over,” she said. “At this point, we are all clueless on who could possibly have done this, because she was never open to us on who she was romantically involved with,” Visser said.
>
> Police spokesperson Elifas Kuwinga yesterday confirmed that Fredricks’ body was discovered by a passer-by in a riverbed next to Chairman Mao Zedong High School at Otjomuise.
>
> “The body has multiple stab wounds and the [genitals] of the deceased was [mutilated] and placed on [her] chest. What is suspected to be [her] clothes were found at a distance from the body along Ghanzi Street, as well as several blood spots along the road,” he said.
>
> Kuwinga said Fredricks’ aunt said she left home on Wednesday morning between 10h00 and 11h00 in the company of a friend and never returned home. “The last they heard is that they parted ways with the friend at the Otjomuise shops, until the discovery of [her] mutilated body this morning [yesterday]. Investigations continue,” he said.

Especially a trans woman of color.”

She had been stabbed multiple times before the fire was started.

> The LGBTIQ+ community in the Northern Cape has been shaken by the brutal murder of a 27-year-old transgender woman, Jo-Ann Isaks.
> 
> Police revealed that the victim, who they identified as [deadname] Isaks, was found in a burning room on the night of Wednesday, 14 May in the Upington township of Paballelo.
> 
> It is understood that a family member noticed the flames coming from Isaks’ room at around 23:00 and went to investigate. While trying to extinguish the blaze, they found her lifeless body, which had already caught fire.
> 
> “It was further discovered that the body had multiple stab wounds on the upper body,” said Sgt Omphile Masegela from the ZF Mgcawu District Municipality, who confirmed that a murder case had been opened. “There have been no arrests at this stage, and the investigation is at a critical stage.
> 
> Jenny Sambok, district leader of the LGBTIQ+ community in the ZF Mgcawu region, told MambaOnline: “The sector is devastated. We are left with so many questions. “We are aware that there’s too much discrimination in the area where this incident happened. The stigma in our communities is still very huge. They still treat us as if it is a choice that we have to be LGBTIQ+,” said Sambok.
> 
> Northern Cape LGBTIQ+ group D’Gayle Diamonds condemned Jo-Ann Isaks’ murder as a “tragic loss that has sent shockwaves through our communities.”
>
> The organisation said: “The circumstances surrounding her death are not only heartbreaking but also a stark reminder of the violence and discrimination that queer individuals continue to face in our society. “It is unacceptable that individuals are targeted and subjected to such heinous acts simply because of their sexual orientation or gender identity”.
> 
> D’Gayle Diamonds called on the police to ensure a thorough investigation to ensure that those responsible are swiftly brought to justice. The authorities, it said, must consider the possibility that Isaks’ murder “may have been a hate crime motivated by prejudice” against her identity as a queer individual.

She was kind, deeply caring, courageous, and fearless. Michelle’s death is a profound loss for our community. There are no words to fully convey what we are collectively feeling right now — our grief is immense. We want to thank those who cherished Michelle, and our hearts are with all who had the opportunity to truly know, love, and care for her.”

What's up with him?
It gets under my skin

I got lost and I rolled with it
What's that she said?

It's just a moment with all that pails to notice
Now figures slip and storm the sense.

> Roberta Lucía Marrero Gutiérrez (2 March 1972 – 17 May 2024) was a Spanish artist, singer, and actress.
> 
> In her works as an illustrator, Roberta Marrero mixed and de-contextualized popular images, giving rise to new meanings, and using the technique of artistic appropriation. For example, in her first published book, Dictadores (2015), she transforms several photographs of icons of totalitarianism with images related to the pop world. She thus shows Mao Zedong surrounded by characters whose faces have been covered by Hello Kitty heads, and presents a portrait of Francisco Franco made up with a lightning bolt on his face, in the style of David Bowie on the cover of Aladdin Sane. With this publication, the artist stated that her intention was to ""Vandalize a fascist message and turn it into another one of freedom.""
> 
> In her 2016 book El bebé verde: infancia, transexualidad y héroes del pop, a graphic novel with a prologue by the writer Virginie Despentes, Marrero collects memories of her childhood and her transsexuality, explaining how the worldview of various artists from pop music, literature, and cinema inspired her, especially Boy George. The main themes in her work are power, death, fame, love, and politics.
> 
> In addition to exhibiting in Spanish galleries such as ""La Fiambrera"" in Madrid, some of her works have been included in exhibitions such as David Bowie Is, organized by the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, and Piaf, at the Bibliothèque nationale de France. Joe Dallesandro, model, actor and star of Andy Warhol's The Factory, chose one of her illustrations for limited edition t-shirts. Precisely, the author points to Warhol as her main influence. In addition, she samples from the Fauvist movement, expressionism, surrealism, Catholic religious painting, classical Hollywood, and punk.
> 
> In 2016 Marrero denounced British fashion designer Vivienne Westwood on social media, claiming that one of her works had been plagiarized on a shirt sold through Westwood's website. The designer and her husband Andreas Kronthaler responded that the image had been copied without knowledge that it was a work by a contemporary artist.
> 
> As a musician, Marrero released two electropop albums and worked as a DJ at several Spanish clubs.


Roberta's final work was a collection of poems titled ""[Derecho a Cita](https://www.casadellibro.com/libro-derecho-a-cita/9788419323200/15894097)"" (""Right To Quote"").

>""Writer, artist and poet Roberta Marrero returns in this second collection of poems, Right to Quote,
to an imaginary of our own that speaks to us about everything of desire. A desire sometimes consummated, sometimes
frustrated times, and that accompanies on this occasion From countless quotes drawn from the vast universe
bibliography that makes up the creative universe of the author.
>
> Can you imagine a room with Pizarnik, Lemebel, Saint Teresa of Jesus, Marrero, Crisp, Sexton...? All on velvet couches listening to Lana of the King.
>
> You never said the party was always funny, your corpse, I mean, a collection of poems, is rather the Longer hangover after the brief wish party. Be maybe the saddest party in the universe, but Nan Goldin will take the pictures, and then it will have been worth the sorrow.
>
> And that, I think, is what this collection of poems is about.""

He had been admitted to hospital because of alleged abuse by his family.

Media reporting misgendered him.

> A few days ago, a 22-year-old trans boy, after being kidnapped while in the emergency room of the Vizzolo Predabissi hospital, [died by suicide in the hospital]. The victim's friends published an open letter on social media to try to shed light on what happened.
> 
> Last May 27, a trans boy arrived at the hospital in Vizzolo Predabissi (Milan), as reported by ANSA, for alleged abuse that had occurred in his family. Once he arrived at the hospital, the young man was attacked while he was on a stretcher. The boy, after reporting the incident, was then transported to a second hospital, and then inexplicably taken back to the first hospital.
> 
> Here the young man, after being left alone in a room on the fourth floor of the building, perhaps suffering from mental fragility due to the violence he had suffered, [died by suicide]. After many articles about the story, the victim's friends decided to write and share a letter to clarify what happened.
> 
> “This morning the newspapers reported the death of our friend, which occurred on the evening of the 28th,” the letter begins. “After having presented himself at the emergency room of the Vizzolo Predabissi hospital in a state of mental fragility, he was raped by another patient. After immediately reporting the incident to the staff, he was taken to the Mangiagalli hospital, where injuries consistent with abuse were confirmed.” The boy, the letter continues, “was taken back to the first hospital, where the violence had occurred, for social shelter, an emergency measure for people who have nowhere to go to be safe. Shortly after, he [died by suicide].”
> 
> “Despite the fact that he was a trans boy whose male pronouns were clearly indicated on his social profiles, all the newspapers called him 'woman' and referred to him with his old female pronouns. We have many questions about what happened, ” the letter continues. And in fact, initially the newspapers, unaware of some information, reported the news incorrectly, referring to the victim as female.
> 
> The young victim's friends rightly wonder how it is possible that such violence could have occurred ""in a protected place like a hospital"", why the young man was left alone despite ""a traumatic event and a difficult and well-documented psychiatric history"" and, above all, why the boy died ""alone and without protection"".

> 
> [Name reacted]'s eldest child, 41-year-old Jamie Dooley, spent his final moments in jail before dying on May 28.
> 
> ""It takes less than one night to die here, but [Jamie] managed to live on the street for three years without an overdose or even one close call,"" Melissa told CBC Hamilton, saying his death has been ""catastrophic"" for her family.
> 
> It's been almost a month since Dooley died and questions are swirling about how it happened. Andrew Morrison, a spokesperson for Ontario's Ministry of the Solicitor General, confirmed a prisoner died on May 28. He said an investigation is underway, but couldn't share any other details.
> 
> Dooley is remembered for his generosity, his love for family, and his athleticism and work as a sous chef, among other things.  He grew up in Hamilton, where he was bullied in school and was assaulted in adulthood because he was a trans man, his family said.
> 
> Before the COVID-19 pandemic, Dooley moved to St. John's in hopes of having a fresh start. His family said he would buy bikes, paint them and give them away for free.
> 
> During the pandemic, Dooley's family said, he developed paranoia and other mental health issues. His family suspects the isolation may have been hard on Dooley, who always loved having company.
> 
> When Dooley returned to Hamilton a year later, his mental health had deteriorated. He ended up unhoused and sleeping in tents. His family said they tried getting Dooley help for his mental health and he had attempted suicide multiple times, but he was never officially diagnosed and was quickly released from hospitals.
> 
> On May 26, Dooley's family said, police arrested him while he was outside for missing a court date a month earlier. They said he spent a night in a holding cell before being remanded to the jail and entering segregation.
> 
> Dooley's family suggested he may have been put in segregation because he was trans. The province didn't answer questions about if Dooley was in segregation and if so, why. Dooley's family said he refused breakfast at 7 a.m. on May 28 and was found unresponsive at 11 a.m.
> 
> Ontario has long faced calls to end segregation in its jails, but a CBC investigation shows prisoners are being isolated more often. In Hamilton, it's happening at a higher rate than elsewhere in the province, meeting the UN's threshold for torture. An advocate for incarcerated people recalls her time in segregation as being ""in a little cream-coloured box with nothing."" CBC Hamilton's Bobby Hristova explains.
> 
> His family said an autopsy was done and found Dooley's cause of death was ""unnatural,"" and they're waiting for the toxicology report. Sudden deaths from unnatural causes in jails automatically trigger provincial inquests.
> 
> Family members suspect it was an overdose because they say a small bag with crystals was found near Dooley's body in the jail. Where the bag came from is unclear.
> 
> Dooley's family said he self-medicated with crystal meth and fought drug addiction that got worse during the pandemic.

Yomaira Castañeda,67,,,,31-May-2024,,,,Bogotá,Distrito Capital,Colombia,4.6489055,-74.4375105,medical,cosmetic filler complications,"Yomaira passed away as a result of complications caused by biopolymers used in cosmetic filler injections over 30 years earlier. In death, her family erased her identity.

> On May 31, 2024, Yomaira, a 67-year-old trans woman, passed away after decades of fighting the physical and emotional consequences caused by the injection of biopolymers into her body. Her story is a reflection of the clandestine procedures that many trans people undergo in Colombia. Yomaira not only carried the weight of her identity, but also that of a health system that did not provide her with care.
> 
> Yomaira arrived in Bogotá escaping the abuse and rejection she had faced since her childhood in Teruel, Huila. She was born into a deeply sexist environment, surrounded by 11 brothers who never understood her desire to be herself. By the age of ten, she was already a victim of sexual exploitation and abuse, and soon after she left home to survive on the streets of the capital, where drugs and alcohol became her temporary refuge.
> 
> At 33, in search of reaffirming her feminine identity, Yomaira decided to undergo clandestine cosmetic procedures that would change her life forever. She injected biopolymers into her buttocks, face, legs and breasts, hoping to achieve the figure she longed for. However, this decision was the beginning of an ordeal. Her body began to react severely to the injected products, generating rashes, wounds and pain that accompanied her for more than three decades.
> 
> Yomaira's physical deterioration was evident from the beginning. Seven years after undergoing the biopolymer injection, her skin began to redden and ooze, and the toxic substances spread throughout her body, even affecting her bones and lungs. Every time she went to medical centers, the response was the same: rejection. Health institutions were not prepared to treat her condition, and argued that the EPS did not cover this type of illness.
> 
> During her final years, Yomaira lived with Mrs. Maria Parra, who took her in as an adopted daughter when she arrived in Bogotá in search of a home. Maria was her guardian angel, taking care of her healing and accompanying her in the physical and emotional torment she suffered. However, not even this support could save her from the fate that the biopolymers had wrought on her. “Yomaira was already tired,” said Maria, who watched her slowly fade away.
> 
> On June 2, 2024, Yomaira's funeral was held. However, what was experienced that day was a final betrayal of her identity. Instead of honoring the woman who had fought to be herself, her biological family decided to say goodbye to “[deadname] Castañeda”. Yomaira's body lay dressed as a man, in a plaid shirt and beige pants, denying her life and identity even in death.
> 
> “You will always be Yomaira, you will never be [deadname],” were the words that echoed among the few friends who accompanied her at her funeral. While her blood family tried to erase all traces of her true identity, her trans friends, those who shared with her the most difficult moments of her life, mourned the silent end of a woman who always fought to be recognized.
