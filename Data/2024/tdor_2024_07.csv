Dayana Hernández González,40,15-Jul-1983,2024_07_01_Dayana-Hernandez-Gonzalez.jpg,https://www.crhoy.com/nacionales/fallece-dayana-hernandez-activista-trans-y-excandidata-a-diputada/,1-Jul-2024,,,,San José,San José,Costa Rica,9.9357047,-84.1957495,medical,cosmetic filler complications,"Dayana died from long-term complications caused by biopolymer injections. She was an activist, and the first trans woman to stand as a deputy to the Legislative Assembly in 2018.

> Dayana Hernández González (San José, July 15, 1983 - July 1, 2024) was a trans consultant on issues related to access to health, STIs and HIV, and a Costa Rican activist for transgender rights and human rights. She was the founder and director of the Transvida organization. In 2018, she was the first trans woman to be a candidate for deputy to the Legislative Assembly.
> 
> Within activism, Hernández was a reference person in the Country Coordinating Mechanism. She was also the national coordinator of REDLACTRANS, a member of the Trans Block Platform and a collaborator of UNAIDS. She was co-manager of the program ""From the streets to the classrooms"", which won the Award for Improvements to the Quality of Life of Costa Ricans and led the Diverse Companies project.
> 
> Born in San José, the capital of Costa Rica in 1983, she worked as a [sex worker] in the early 2000s, while also becoming involved in activism. In 2002, a doctor gave her biopolymer injections in her hips, breasts and buttocks, which caused her health problems. She was also a stylist, and studied English at the Instituto Nacional de Aprendizaje, an aptitude that led her to get a job in a call center. She also studied Portuguese and computing.
> 
> In 2009, together with other colleagues, she founded Transvida, an organization dedicated to improving the living conditions of the Costa Rican trans population, especially the collective of trans women, through educational and medical care, as well as access to employment.
> 
> In 2016, she reported the Costa Rican Social Security Fund for negligence and gender violence when her search for medical attention was ignored, or she was a victim of deadnaming by health personnel.
> 
> In 2017, she announced her candidacy for the political party VAMOS for the position of deputy for the Legislative Assembly in the 2018 general elections, which made her the first trans woman to stand as a candidate for Congress. 2 She ran second on the list for the province of San José. She had to do so with her name and birth gender since there was no Costa Rican law that allows the registration of a change of sex on an identity document.
> 
> On May 1, 2018, she led a protest demanding a trans labor quota and regularization of sex work.
> 
> She passed away on July 1, 2024. Various Costa Rican and Latin American organizations paid tribute to her through their social media accounts.

*[Editor's Note: Gender neutral pronouns are used in this report as although it is known that Kenji identified as trans, there are conflicting reports on whether she identified as a trans person or a trans woman or some other identity]*

> A [person] was reported shot to death just after midnight in an E Pine parking lot.
> 
> In a chaotic sequence starting just before 12:30 AM Monday, police responded to reports of gunfire in the parking lot of Teto’s Cantina, the former Rancho Bravo restaurant at the corner of 10th and Pine across from Cal Anderson Park.
> 
> Arriving officers searched the lot before reporting a woman down at the scene and at least one person taken into custody amid crowds of people in the neighborhood during Pride festivities, according to East Precinct radio updates.
> 
> Seattle Fire was called to the scene but reported the victim had died of [their] injuries. UPDATE: “Crews attempted lifesaving efforts for an adult [person] but were unsuccessful,” SFD reports. “[They were] declared deceased at the scene.”
> 
> Homicide detectives were called the scene. Police were collecting evidence including video from the scene as E Pine was closed to traffic during the response. Police were also continuing to search for possible suspects reported leaving the scene. There were no additional reported arrests.
> 
> The Seattle Police Department has not provided details of the shooting or confirmed the killing. Q13 and KING are also reporting the deadly shooting but providing an E Pike location that differs from overnight emergency radio updates.


> Kenji’s Black Trans life mattered and we mourn the absences and the invisibility of what we can not know. We mourn the silence of her story that has taken 18 days to reach our community. We mourn the ways gun violence took a 23 year old’s life, full of promise, and we bear the weight of knowing these tragedies are not Washington state specific.
> 
> When Kenji’s former teacher Malia Burns says, “Kenji was a bright light in our lives, known for an infectious smile and quick wit. Kenji had an extraordinary ability to uplift everyone around with laughter, a joke, a song, or a dance.”, we know Kenji was a ki. Though many of us have not met Kenji in the flesh, we feel the power of her light even through photos and the stories shared by her loved ones.
> 
> We know that young people, especially Black trans young people are the key to overturning a world riddled with anti-Blackness, transphobia, misogynoir, and premature death. So we honor the lives Kenji’s touched, and we grieve the future possibilities of the new world Kenji may have ushered us into if given the opportunity at life.
> 
> Many of us dream of the PNW to be a safe haven, of care and refuge for Black trans life, and we hope that it will one day become that for all our community. Rest well, Kenji.

"Carolina Machado Abad (""Heidi"", ""Clarita"")",30,30-Aug-1994,,,5-Jul-2024,,Parque Florentino Amegnino,Parque Patricios,Buenos Aires,Buenos Aires,Argentina,-34.6366254,-58.396919,uncategorised,not reported,"Carolina died at a bus stop outside a hospital. She had been unable to find shelter during a cold snap that claimed the lives of several homeless people in Buenos Aires.

> Buenos Aires, Argentina. On Monday afternoon, Carolina Machado Abad, a trans woman who had migrated from Ecuador, died homeless during the cold snap in Buenos Aires. She was to have turned 30 on August 30. 
> 
> “I had a transfer to a shelter in my pocket,” Georgina Orellano, director of Casa Roja and general secretary of Asociación de Mujeres Meretrices de Argentina (AMMAR), told [Presentes](https://agenciapresentes.org/2024/07/17/caba-una-mujer-trans-murio-en-la-calle-mientras-esperaba-turno-para-un-parador/). Carolina was a sex worker and had gone to Casa Roja, in the Constitución neighborhood, where they helped her start the immigration process. She had obtained temporary residency and was waiting for her national identity document. 
> 
> Over the past month, Carolina spent several nights at the Uspallata hostel, run by the Buenos Aires City Government. Police found her body in the plaza in front of the Muñiz Hospital, in Parque Patricios. “She was hospitalized for a long time at the Ramos Mejía hospital. When she left, she found herself in absolute precariousness, unable to receive assistance from the State policies, which are very limited. One of the requirements to receive any subsidy is to have regularized immigration status,” Orellano explained. 
> 
> The last time her companions saw her was on Friday, July 5. She went to Casa Roja asking to be admitted to a home. “We called several centers and they were all full. The social workers at the different centers told us that they had no vacancies. There was no room, there was a waiting list. “They gave her an appointment to appear on July 16, ” said Orellano, who is organizing Carolina's farewell at Casa Roja. They have already contacted her family and hope to repatriate her body. 

Carolina's death coincided with statements by the Secretary of Security of Buenos Aires, Diego Kravetz, who said: ""If as a neighbor you give a plate of hot soup to a person who lives on the street, you are making them poor.""

Kravetz's comments - which appear to be part of an intentional hostility by the authorities in the area towards homeless people - came after at least 7 deaths of homeless people in Buenos Aires in the previous two weeks.
 
> The organizations believe that these deaths are linked to the emptying of housing policies and the hardening of discrimination and violence by the City Government towards people living on the streets. According to figures from April, there are 3,560 homeless people in the capital of the country. This represents an increase of 14% compared to last year. However, civil society organizations report 8,028 homeless people, according to this note from the media Chequeado. 
> 
>  “Jorge Macri said that homeless people are dangerous and that the whole approach had to be changed. They created a mental health protocol that allows people to be taken to psychiatric wards involuntarily. The Borda Hospital has been denouncing this. The government said that they are opening new shelters, but for months every time you call the 108 line there is no vacancy,” Paula Migilone from NTD told Presentes. She added: “They have an under-measure of the number of homeless people. Everything got worse with the elimination of specific public policies for women and dissidents. They are making a policy of displacement, they don’t want them to be seen. And that has short legs, because people are dying and now these policies are reaching the media.” 

*[Editor's note: several sources also name Carolina as ""Heidi"" and ""Clarita""]*

> Yesterday Diego Kravetz, Secretary of City Security said that people in street situations do not go to bus stops because they don't want to. 
>
>The previous day Heidi went to the same stop on Uspallata Street where she used to spend the night. There was no room. There was no bed. That's the reality. Heidi, as she was called on the street. Clarita, as her family told her, Carolina Machado Abad, as stated in her documents, died abandoned by the State. She was Ecuadorian. She was trans and migrant.

> 
> They also question the government's inaction in the face of these murders. ""Always the same indifference and embarrassed silence from the political class (...) We therefore demand that the next government puts a stop to transphobia ."" The associations have therefore launched a call for a rally. It will be held on July 16 at 6 p.m. on the Human Rights Square, Place du Trocadéro, in Paris, they specified in a joint press release.

""Transphobic hatred and violence have no place in our society (...) All light must be shed by the courts,"" wrote the DILCRAH on X on Tuesday.

*[Editor's Note: The victim's name, age and the exact location of her death are not known, but we estimate the murder occurred around 22nd July.]*

Before that happened her trans status had been publicly leaked, so she was in immediate danger of harm even before being deported via the Cilvegözü Border Gate.

Prior to being deported it is believed that she had been living in Adana.

> Adana LGBTI+ Solidarity on July 27 announced that a Syrian trans woman who were deported by Turkish authorities to Syria over her HIV status were killed in there five days ago.
> 
> LGBTI+ news outlet KaosGL reported that she was killed by Free Syrian Army and her family.
> 
> On July 5, local news outlets and several social media users shared medical documents about the refugee woman with serious hate speech. 
> 
> Even though it is illegal to disclose any person’s medical information in Turkey, authorities decided to deport the refugee woman instead of punishing those involved in the crime.
> 
> Adana LGBTI+ Solidarity stated, “In Adana, a Syrian trans woman had her private health information shared without consent and faced hate speech. This violated her personal rights and privacy. Trans woman M.E. was deported through the Cilvegözü Border Gate following these events. Unfortunately, we learned that she passed away five days ago.”
> 
> The solidarity underscored that Turkey should no longer be defined as a ""safe country"" for LGBTI+ asylum seekers and refugees.
