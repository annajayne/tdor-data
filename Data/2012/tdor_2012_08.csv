She died in hospital.

> The National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs is calling attention to the fatal shooting of Kendall L. Hampton, a gender-nonconforming person who had reportedly been involved in sex work.
>
> The 26-year-old victim was discovered in the parking lot of a Cincinnati convenience store last Saturday, reported Fox 19. Hampton was pronounced dead later that night at the city's University Hospital. Police are currently searching for the gunman.

In death, media reports misgendered her.

> I posted last week about the Hampton trans murder case in Ohio and my pissivity over the almost immediate deployment of the Black trans unwoman meme' in the initial reports by several Cincinnati media outlets. The local media in addition to immediately misgendering her, assumed Hampton was engaged in sex work, which pissed me off still further.
>
> Well, interestingly enough, there's a story that came out yesterday in GLBTNewsCincinnati.com by Worley Rodehaver about this latest trans murder based on an interview with a person purported to be a relative of Hampton's named Terri.
>
> According to the article, Hampton had just had a fistfight with a transphobe who called her names, and the cismale she vanquished was being teased by other males for being beat up by a 'fag'.

In September 2012, Eugene Carlos Dukes, 19, was arrested and charged with murder.

> 19 year old Eugene Carlos Dukes was arrested in September 2012 and charged with Hampton's murder.   But the wheels of justice have been moving at a glacial pace in this case since Duke's indictment by the Hamilton County grand jury.

> In 2012, a total of 17 members of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender community in the Caribbean Region were victims of attacks on their lives, according to the Caribe Affirmative report. Shania Vanessa was with her co-workers at 3:30 in the morning of August 5, 2012 on 22nd Street and Carrera 17 in the center of Sincelejo. The trans woman was approached by a young man, no older than 20, who was traveling on a black motorcycle and asked her to accompany him to a motel to have sex. Hours later, Shania Vanessa was found dead in an abandoned spot in the capital Sucreña with a bullet in the head.
> 
> Days later, a companion of Shania Vanessa revealed to the group of trans that that same man the night before of the homicide had tried to kill her at the exit to Tolú. Another who knew both cases said later that a man with the same characteristics had beaten and raped her several weeks ago in that same sector. 
> 
> On the night of the murder, the man on the motorbike who had gone for Shania Vanessa, came back for another girl claiming that the deceased had fallen asleep. At the same time a taxi driver arrived at the site and told the trans group that they had found a trans woman dead in the La Selva neighborhood wherupon the the man on the motorcycle left immediately.
> 
> A month later, the taxi driver was found dead by a firearm near a road to the Tolu Variants and the police captured his alleged murderer and who, for Shania Vanessa's classmates, is the same young man on the black motorcycle.
> 
> This is just one of the homicide cases perpetrated against the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community in the department of Sucre, according to the report ""A greater visibility, greater risk"" of the Caribbean Affirmative Corporation.

> MIAMI(CBS4) – Miami Police homicide detectives are trying to find out if a 33-year-old [woman] was killed early Sunday because [she was trans].
> 
> A CBS4 crew caught up with those investigators exclusively as Detective Frankie Sanchez lead them through a neighborhood around 60 N.W. 77th St., where the crime happened early Sunday morning as most people were sleeping and inside as Tropical Storm Isaac was approaching South Florida.
> 
> Sanchez and his team handed out flyers asking for the public’s help showing the most recent picture of the victim, 33-year-old Dewayne “Deja” Jones, who lived just seven blocks north of where the shooting happened.
> 
> “We’re struggling for leads,” Sanchez told CBS4’s Peter D’Oench. “We don’t know who [she] was with. That’s always possible that someone did this because of [the fact that she was trans]. We’re looking for any information. Anything that someone may have seen with someone running or driving away from the area, any information that would help us figure out what happened to [her].”
