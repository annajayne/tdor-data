In August 2017 Gary N. Montgomery, 55, was acquitted of her murder.

> A D.C. Superior Court trial began on Wednesday for a District man charged with first-degree murder while armed for the February 2012 stabbing death of transgender woman Deoni JaParker Jones, 23, at a bus stop in Northeast Washington.
> 
> Police and prosecutors charged Gary N. Montgomery, who was 55 at the time of the incident, with stabbing Jones in the head as she stood at a bus stop near her home at East Capitol Street and Sycamore Road, N.E. on the evening of Feb. 2, 2012.
> 
> The incident shocked members of the LGBT community who organized vigils at the site of the stabbing and called for greater efforts to curtail hatred and bias toward transgender people.
> 
> Police identified and arrested Montgomery less than a week after the stabbing based on information provided by witnesses and nearby residents.
> 
> The verdict shocked Jones’s family members and LGBT activists, who believed prosecutors and homicide detectives presented a strong case that defendant Gary Montgomery committed the murder. But court observers said the defense raised a number of issues challenging the evidence presented by prosecutors in a trial that began five years after Montgomery was arrested on a charge of first-degree murder while armed.
> 
> The issues brought up by the defense apparently succeeded in raising sufficient doubt in the minds of the jurors that prompted them to hand down a not guilty verdict, according to at least one court observer.
