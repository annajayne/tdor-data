She had been shot in the forehead.

> One block east of the Citgo, a rusty viaduct crosses Madison at the corner of Kenton Avenue. It was under this viaduct that some of the transgender women who were engaged in sex work (locally referred to as ""on the stroll"") with 23-year-old Paige Clay say they last saw Clay getting into a car with an unknown man or group of men. On April 16, 2012, Clay's body was discovered half a mile away from the viaduct in an alley in the 4500 block of West Jackson. She had been shot through the head.
> 
> An LGBT advocate and former child welfare worker who asked to be identified as ""John"" told Windy City Times that he was the man who identified Clay's body at the morgue and then had the task of informing her family of her death—a memory that haunts him to this day.
> 
> ""Paige loved life. She was a strong-willed individual,"" he told Windy City Times. ""Paige wanted to work in the fashion industry. Paige had the skills to be successful on so many levels but didn't have the services and support mechanisms around her to do that and that's why she had to resort to the kind of life that she had. We have a public school system that has let trans people down. It's not inclusive enough to trans individuals and is doing nothing help nurture them. Trans women of color come out of it totally unprepared and they have to rely on prostitution as a means of survival. We may not like to think about it, but it's their truth. It's their reality. It was very disheartening for Paige to go on job interviews in retail stores and—even though she was very well put together and more than qualified to do the job—to be denied because she was trans.""

> Justice is now investigating as a possible perpetrator the defendant in the Barneix case, who in a conversation claimed the homicides.
>
> Justice is investigating the man who was sentenced to prison for the threats in the Barneix case, for the murder of [six] trans women. These killings, which occurred between 2011 and 2012, have yet to be clarified. In the seizure of documents from the defendant's house, Nicolás Gonella mentions in a conversation with an individual from a foreign organization that he was responsible for these murders.

Witnesses believed that it was a hate crime.

Her killer was postumously identified several years later.

> OAKLAND — On the eve of the 17th annual Transgender Day of Remembrance, Oakland police have identified a resident fatally shot three years ago as the man who killed a transgender woman weeks earlier, authorities said Thursday. Brandy Martell, 37, was shot about 5:20 a.m. April 29, 2012, while sitting in a car at 13th and Franklin streets.
>
> Police have identified Malique Parrott, 26, as the man who killed Martell in what was initially described as a possible hate crime, but Oakland police Sgt. Brad Baker said it was a botched robbery. Parrott was killed June 10, 2012, in the 2200 block of Foothill Boulevard. Baker, who has worked the case from the beginning, said Thursday that he initially received information that led to the possibility of Parrott’s involvement in Martell’s death.
>
> But it was not until last August that Baker was able to find a man who was with Parrott that night and who identified him as the shooter. That, paired with additional legwork to collaborate the statement, led Baker to take the developments to the Alameda County District Attorney’s Office this week. Baker, who has spoken with Martell’s mother, said the family is thankful for the closure of the case.
>
> Tiffany Woods, Martell’s former supervisor at the Tri-City Health Center in Fremont, works as the Oakland police liaison to the East Bay transgender community. Woods praised the department’s diligence.
>
> “The solving of Brandy Martell’s murder, hopefully, provides some measure of closure for her family, friends and community. To know that there is no longer a killer on the loose is pause for relief,” Woods said Thursday.
>
> “Although it took three long years to finally identify the shooter responsible for her senseless and hateful killing, I applaud the detectives and Oakland Police Department for keeping Brandy’s case active and continuously working the case for leads to bring justice for Brandy Martell and closure for her family.”
>
> Martell worked as a peer advocate for TransVisions, which provides services for transgender people, from 2007 to 2011, when program funding was cut and she was laid off, Woods said. Martell also helped organize five annual Alameda County Transgender Day of Remembrance events in Oakland before her death.

Her body was found lying on her bed with fatal stab wounds after neighbours noticed a bad smell coming from her flat on 4th June 2012.

Her exact date of death is unknown, but she is thought to have been murdered sometime in April 2012.

In October 2013, Romy Maynard, 28, was sentenced to life imprisonment for her murder. Forensic evidence placed Maynard at the flat – his fingerprint was found in the kitchen and there were partial DNA matches on the pillow and the victim’s cardigan she was wearing at the time of her death. Crucially a full DNA profile matching Maynard was recovered from a small bloodstain on the duvet the victim was lying on.

Chrissie was due to undergo reassignment surgery later that year.
