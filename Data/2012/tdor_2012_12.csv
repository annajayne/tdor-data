> 
> Paramedics of the Mexican Red Cross and the Municipal Police arrived to the place to confirm the report, where at first they observed the inert body of a woman reclining face down, on a pool of blood, which carried a black dress and sneakers of the same color. When approaching the body, they realised that she was a trans woman who no longer showed had signs and had a large number of injuries caused by a knife, so they immediately notified the elements of the Judicial Police of the State (PJE) and the Public Ministry of the Common Jurisdiction. 
> 
> Upon their arrival, the authorities proceeded to cordon off the area to begin the investigation, where they first traveled the site in search of clues and the belongings of the subject, however, they only found the shoes and a bracelet of the now deceased. When examining the body, they noticed that at first sight the subject had at least 30 injuries caused by a knife in the chest, back and arms, while the face had strong blows and deformation, so it is presumed after of being stabbed was ""crushed"" with the tire of a vehicle. 
> 
> At the scene judicial elements proceeded to question the neighbors and witnesses of the facts, who reported that around 05:40 a two-wheeled vehicle, red, was parked in the place in a suspicious manner which left the place at high speed. They also determined that the subject was attacked when she left a home near the scene, a house where parties are regularly celebrated, and bordered on entering the green area, where she was killed.

Alison was a stylist and sex worker. She had convictions for minor theft and drug offences, but she certainly didn't deserve to die like this.

Members of the gang who attacked her were subsequently jailed for her murder and five others.

She died in hospital. An hour later, the police arrested Víctor York Rojas López, 28, in the Versailles neighborhood.

> There are two hypotheses about motives. Some say her killer ws a client who offered her $5,000 for sex. Yeisi would have accepted and gone with the subject to the Central Cemetery of Magangué (which is used as a motel by several local sex workers, either because of lack of money to enter a motel or because they are denied entry, according to Wilson Castañeda, director of the Caribe Afirmative organization, which defends the rights of the LGBT population). Then there would have been an argument between Yeisi and her client, in which the latter ended up stabbing the trans woman.
> 
> Another version indicates that Yeisi was the receipient of a death threat from someone who had an altercation with some time ago. Supposedly, the subject offered money to a nephew to kill her, and the latter would have posed as a client to take Yeisi to a solitary place and kill her.
