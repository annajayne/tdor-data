Dion Webster,21,,,,4-Nov-1996,tdor.info/4 Nov 1996/Dion Webster,New York,New York,USA,40.713054,-74.007228,violence,stabbed,"Dion died as a result of a knife wound to the head.

> NEW YORK — Dion Webster talked loud and laughed louder. He was a prankster, a kid who got things started. But late one cold November night, his laughter ceased. He was found dead on the street, a knife shoved into his head.
> 
> Kevin Freeman was a quiet young man, an introvert with bright eyes. Six months after his friend Webster was murdered, Freeman's body turned up in a park not far away with his skull split.
> 
> Few mourned these two young men: their fellow street people, some social workers.
> 
> These were people passersby ignored, the type police rousted and arrested. They were homeless, addicted to crack cocaine and stuck in a dead end of life before age 30. Besides, they lived in the hidden realm of the ""transgendered,"" men believing they should have been born female. They worked the streets.
> 
> In a city that boasts its dropping crime rate and safer streets, their murders barely registered. There were no news conferences, no task forces, no public outcry.
> 
> ""They were dead already to the world. When they were killed, it just made it official,"" said Carl Siciliano, a social worker who knew them.

Alan Fitzgerald Walker,,,,,9-Nov-1996,tdor.info/9 Nov 1996/Alan Fitzgerald Walker,Fayetteville,Arkansas,USA,36.061928,-94.160583,violence,beaten and strangled,"Alan was beaten and strangled to death by Adam David Blackford and Yitzak Abba Marta.

> On November 12, 1996, the police discovered Alan Walker's slain body in the floor of his bedroom near the entrance to his bathroom. Mr. Walker had been strangled and beaten several times in the head with a hard metal or wooden object. At the time of his death, Mr. Walker was wearing only a pair of lady's heels and a wig. The letters “KKK” were written in blood on the wall, and there was a significant amount of blood splattered on the walls, ceiling, and bed sheets. A reddish fluid, possibly blood, was found on the bathroom sink. The tires to Mr. Walker's vehicle were slashed, and a television, VCR, boom box, watch, fireplace set, and several rings were missing from his duplex.
>
> After an investigation, the police charged Yitzhak Abba Marta and Adam Blackford with the murder of Mr. Walker. Mr. Marta and Mr. Blackford were tried separately. After Mr. Blackford was convicted of first-degree murder, he agreed to testify against Mr. Marta with the understanding that his testimony might result in some leniency on his sentence. At the beginning of Mr. Marta's trial, the court declared Mr. Blackford an accomplice as a matter of law.
>
> Mr. Blackford then testified that in the early morning hours of November 9, 1996, he and Mr. Marta went to a local bar where they met Mr. Walker, who was dressed as a woman. Both Mr. Blackford and Mr. Marta thought that Mr. Walker was a woman. Mr. Walker invited them back to his home for a party. When they arrived at Mr. Walker's home, Mr. Walker and Mr. Marta went into the bedroom, while Mr. Blackford remained in the living room. Mr. Blackford then decided to steal Mr. Walker's television and boom box for drug money. Mr. Blackford placed both items in the back of his red Chevy pick-up, and then slit the tires to Mr. Walker's car.
>
> Soon after Mr. Blackford reentered the duplex, Mr. Marta came out of the bedroom and exclaimed, “I'm going to Jack him [Mr. Walker] up.” Mr. Blackford retrieved a crowbar from his pick-up truck and handed it to Mr. Marta. Mr. Blackford also disabled both of Mr. Walker's phones. As Mr. Walker exited from his bathroom, Mr. Marta struck him approximately five to ten times with the crowbar. As Mr. Walker attempted to arise from the floor, Mr. Blackford took the crowbar from Mr. Marta and struck Mr. Walker two or three additional times. Mr. Blackford then attempted to remove any trace of their presence from the duplex.
>
> Meanwhile, Mr. Marta wrote the letters “KKK” on the wall with Mr. Walker's blood. During this time, Mr. Marta made several derogatory remarks about Mr. Walker's sexual preference. As the two men left Mr. Walker's duplex, they decided to get rid of the stolen items. The two men smashed the television and boom box and dumped the pieces in a nearby creek. Mr. Blackford later directed the police to the creek where they retrieved portions of the broken television and boom box.
