> It was March 22, 1997. Bags containing body parts were discovered between Mons and Cuesmes. This is the start of the Mons carver case. Five victims are attributed to him: Carmelina Russo, Martine Bohn, Jacqueline Leclercq, Nathalie Godart and Begonia Valencia.

Martine was a transient transgender woman and former sex worker from France who worked at seedy bars in both France and Belgium. Following her disappearance, police learned that she had lost all contact with her family and hadn’t kept many friends during her life. When her partial remains were found floating in the Haine River [in July 1997], investigators deduced that the killer had sliced off her breasts after learning that Bohn was trans. This provided further proof that the killer was motivated by sex.
