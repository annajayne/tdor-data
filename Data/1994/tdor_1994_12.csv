Shortly beforehand she had called her husband to tell him that someone was trying to break into the house.

In January 2023 - 28 years after her death - James Grimsley, 55, was arrested for murder.

> CONCORD — Nearly 30 years after a Concord transgender woman was found beaten and strangled to death in her and her husband’s Concord apartment, police have arrested a Utah resident on a murder charge.
>
> James Grimsley, 55, was arrested Friday and booked into Salt Lake County jail in Utah on a $1 million fugitive warrant. Contra Costa County prosecutors have charged him with murder for allegedly strangling 28-year-old Terrie Ladwig on Dec. 2, 1994.
>
> Police say they’re still investigating the motive. Grimsley is being extradited to Contra Costa County this week, authorities said.
>
> Concord police Lt. Sean Donnelly wouldn’t say how police linked Grimsley to the crime, other than noting there was “forensic evidence” at the scene. He said Grimsley was identified after police looked into Ladwig’s homicide as part of a periodical re-review of the department’s cold case killings.
>
> “We are confident he is the person who committed this murder,” Donnelly said in an interview.
>
> Grimsley, an Oregon native who lived in the Salt Lake City area, is employed as a trucker. Police are investigating his ties to the Bay Area, but say his job could have brought him to Contra Costa County in the 1990s.
>
> The criminal complaint against Grimsley includes a lone charge of murder with no enhancements. Police said at the time that Ladwig was strangled with an extension cord and beaten.
>
> Ladwig lived on Adelaide Street in Concord with her husband, who worked in the U.S. Navy. The Contra Costa Times reported in 2004 that Ladwig called her husband to report someone was trying to break into the house, and that when he rushed home from a base in Bangor, Wash., he discovered her body. Police said at the time there did not appear to be forced entry into the home.
