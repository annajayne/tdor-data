"Michelle Carrasco ""Chela""",54,,,,16-Mar-2007,"tdor.info/16 Mar 2007/Michelle Carrasco ""Chela""",,Lo Espejo,Santiago,Santiago,Chile,-33.5205351,-70.7062531,violence,beaten,"Michelle was beaten so badly her face was completely disfigured. Her body was left abandoned in a pit.

> At approximately 8 a.m. on the morning of March 16, authorities in Santiago discovered the lifeless body of a transgender prostitute. Family members later identified her as 54-year-old Michelle Carrasco – or ""Chela,"" as her friends called her.
> 
> Carrrasco, her face completely disfigured, had been left in a makeshift pit, presumably by the person who at some point during the previous night brutally attacked her while she worked the road to Melipilla, waiting for clients in Santiago’s Lo Espejo district. 
> 
> Two weeks later, her family and friends are still trying to cope with the horrific murder. ""We’re doing so badly, just bad,"" says Zujeiy Carrasco, the victim’s niece. ""You know where she was working, right? It’s just that she didn’t have any other choices,"" she adds, trying unsuccessfully to hold back the tears.
> 
> Adding to the tragedy is the fact that Carrasco’s death came just a week-and-a-half after a transgender person named [Moira Donaire González](https://tdor.translivesmatter.info/reports/2007/03/05/moira-donaire-gonzalez_vina-del-mar-valparaiso-chile_c8112f94) was also murdered, in Viña del Mar, Region V. González, 30, died on March 5 after being stabbed five times by a street vendor.
> 
> ""We’re just indignant. To put it simply, today in Chile the State is not guaranteeing a basic human right for a certain sector of the population, and that’s the right to life,"" says Rolando Jiménez, president of the Movement for Homosexual Integration and Freedom (MOVILH).
> 
> ""Ultimately, that right isn’t guaranteed because the transgender population, in this society, is forced to support itself in the sex trade. For the people in that line of work, it’s a context that is absolutely precarious and dangerous and in which they’re vulnerable.""

Ruby Ordeñana Mendieta/Ruby Rodriguez,27,,2007_03_16_Ruby-Ordenana-Mendieta.jpg,http://www.carlaantonelli.com/noticias_marzo2007.htm,16-Mar-2007,tdor.info/16 Mar 2007/Ruby Rodriguez,César Chávez and Indiana streets,Potrero Hill,San Francisco,California,USA,37.7501581,-122.3926455,violence,strangled,"Ruby was found naked in the street near Interstate 280 in the Potrero Hill district. She had been strangled.

A vigil was held a week after her murder, at the corner of 24th and Mission Streets, known as the ""Corner of the Nicas"", while a memorial altar was placed in César Chávez and Indiana streets next to the place where the body was found.

Her family could not afford to have her body transported home to Nicaragua.

> Ordenana – also known as Ruby Rodriguez – was a 27-year-old transgender woman living in the San Francisco Bay Area. She was originally from Nicaragua and had immigrated to the United States like many others, to make a better life for herself. She was involved within the local community, attending area support groups and attending language classes.
>
> She was also a sex worker in the Tenderloin district, fighting issues of drug addiction, and struggling with immigration.
>
> On March 16, 2007 — a little before 6:00 a.m. — Ruby’s body was discovered on the sidewalk of Indiana Street in San Francisco by her friends. She was stripped of her clothes, and presumably dumped there by her killer. She had been strangled to death.
>
>Donzell Francis, 41, was arraigned on her murder and other charges on attacking other trans women in the area in San Francisco Superior Court.

> Lesbia Ordeñana, sister of the victim, stated that due to the economic problems they face, it is really impossible for them to be able to pay for the repatriation expenses of their sister's body. 
> 
> She explained that in the Consular Directorate of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs they confirmed that they did not have funds destined for the repatriation of corpses. The cremation of a corpse has a cost of 1100 dollars, and the repatriation of the ashes could be done through the Nicaraguan consulate in San Francisco, recalled Martinez. 
> 
> The drawback that there is, according to Martinez, is that it is necessary to present a letter where Rudy's family signs their consent. Ruby traveled to the United States with the intention of meeting three of her paternal uncles living in San Francisco, but the first attempt was frustrated after a group of criminals assaulted her and beat her in Guatemala. 
> 
> Then she invested three thousand dollars that a relative gave her so that a coyote could move her to San Francisco, which she achieved, and she dedicated herself to studying English and working presumably at a fast food stand.

Erica Keel,21,,,,23-Mar-2007,tdor.info/23 Mar 2007/Erica Keels,Broad and Thompson streets,North Philadelphia,Philadelphia,Pennsylvania,USA,39.9732057,-75.1612502,violence,run over,"Erica was repeatedly struck by a car.

> Motorist Roland Bottom struck African-American trans woman Erica Keel at about 2 a.m. March 21, 2007, at Broad and Thompson streets in North Philadelphia. Erica, 21, died two days later at Hahnemann University Hospital from multiple injuries. The city’s Medical Examiner’s Office classified her death as a “hit-and-run accident.”
>
> Witnesses and friends of Keel refute that Keel’s death was accidental. Keel was engaged in sex work at the time, and witnesses claimed to have seen Keel enter the car at Broad Street and Girard Avenue. The car then headed North one block, where witnesses say the driver ejected Keel from the car and run over her four times as she lay in the street.
>
> The driver, Roland Bottom, fled the scene but was later apprehended by police. He has yet to face criminal charges, including “hit and run.” When friends of Erica, who are themselves transgender, questioned police officials about the classification of Erica’s death as an “accident,” they were asked to disclose their “birth” names and were told they were “trying to make something out of nothing.”
