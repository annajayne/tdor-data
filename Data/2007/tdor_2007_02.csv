> [Deadname] Gomes, also known as Tatiana, was of Brazilian origins. She was discovered by a jogger on the morning of Monday 19 February 2007, in the middle of a street on the outskirts of Trani, Italy. She had fatal blow to the temple — which police suspect could have been done by a stone — and then her head was slammed by a car door.

> The Court of Trani sentenced Romano Patrizio Lomolino, a 40-year-old suspect from Trani, to 30 years in prison after being convicted f the murder of [deadname] Gomes, which took place on February 18, 2007. His defender, Mario Malcangi, has already made it known that he will appeal the sentence.
>
> That night fourteen years ago Lomolino, together with another suspect, had taken from Gomes, under threat, a sum of money that the [victim] refused to pay: at that point Lomolino had lashed out causing her death.
>
> Lomolino had previously served a 10-year sentence for the robbery of the post office in Largo Petrarca, dating back to March 2007, which ended with the serious injury of a security guard. He was then sentenced to 9 years, for sexual harassment and robbery against a trans [person[ from Bisceglie. However, he was freed again at the beginning of November 2018 after the Court of Appeal had acquitted him.
>
> More recently, Lomolino was the subject of two precautionary custody orders as part of the Medusa operation against a mafia-type criminal association called ""Clan Corda-Lomolino"".
