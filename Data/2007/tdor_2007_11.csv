Her killer then covered her body with a white blanket - with the brown furry scarf used to choke her still bound tightly round her neck.

Shanniel Hyatt, 18, admitted to stealing her mobile phone, Freeview box, DVD player and Oyster card, but said that he had not known that she was transsexual and that she had been 'fit and well' when he left.

Hyatt's barrister Joanna Greenberg QC suggested that Ms Telesford died during a sex game with another man after her client had left. Hyatt was cleared of murder and manslaughter after the jury spent four hours deliberating.
