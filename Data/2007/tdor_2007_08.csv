Roberto González Onrubia,26,,,,29-Aug-2007,,,Fuencarral,Madrid,Madrid,Spain,40.4948708,-3.7134119,violence,beaten and tortured,"Roberto, a 26-year-old transgender man, was held prisoner in his house and subjected to transphobic sexual threats, humiliation, torture, and violence, before being beaten to death. 

His killers were two formerly homeless cisgender women who he had offered refuge in his apartment but who took over his house and held him prisoner for a year before he died, while subjecting him to transphobic sexual threats, humiliation, torture, and violence. Both women were sentenced to 19 years in prison and fined €90,000.

> On more than one occasion Reyes Navarro and Bergantiños forced Onrubia to wear women’s clothing and threatened to prostitute him for additional cash. They did it both to humiliate him as a trans man and to intimidate him sexually, relying on both transphobia and sexism in the sex industry to menace Onrubia as much as their own behavior. They also forced him to give up much of the outward markers that allowed him to live in his chosen gender while again filming the abuse.
> 
> Onrubia’s was found, disfigured by physical abuse, dead in his own excrement and urine. It was clear he had been forced to spend an unknown amount of months living and sleeping on the same mattress where he was forced to go to the bathroom rather than be allowed to use the facilities in the home. He was also extremely malnurished at the time of his death; Reyes Navarro and Bergantiños took pleasure in denying him food and may have even linked the starvation to their transphobic torture by telling him his dwindling body helped him look “more like a man"".
> 
> ""[…] once they stripped him naked and forced him to shave his entire body, while they were recording. It was a way to steal one of his male secondary sex characteristics (body hair) […] They also dressed him up as a girl with high heels and a miniskirt, something they knew he rejected, and threatened to pimp him out as a prostitute.""

Roberto's murder was not recorded on the TDoR list issued by tdor.info in November 2007.
