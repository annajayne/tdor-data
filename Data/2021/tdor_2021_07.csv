She died after posting a Facebook post requesting help to recharge an oxygen tank.

> Fanny Arguello Sánchez, president of the civil association ""Diana Sacayán, transformarse es vivir"" A.C [""Diana Sacayán, transforming is living"" AC], died last Saturday due to Covid-19 in Villa Comaltitlán. Her death shocked the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transsexual, Transgender, Transvestite, Queer and Intersex (LGBTTTIQ +) defense organizations, who saw her as a promoter of the fight for human rights.
> 
> Arguello Sánchez founded the association and led the group up to grow to over 100 members. In their first demands, they called for an end to harassment and acts of violence during their working hours in sex work.
> 
> Later, and with the support of Aida Jiménez Sesma, they put forward the ""Trans Identity Law"", which sought to reform articles 41, 43 and 101, in addition to adding articles 101 bis and 101 ser of the civil code of the state of Chiapas, in order to guarantee the right to recognition of people's identity. However, since 2019 the law has not advanced. The stagnation of the initiative mobilized Arguello and the members of the association. The organization ""Diana Sacayan"" on several occasions condemned transfeminicides that occurred in the state, at the same time, demanded justice given the impunity of the events.
> 
> The State Commission for Human Rights and the Network for Sexual Inclusion expressed their consternation at her death, recognizing her work on behalf of the transgender population in Chiapas. The story of Fanny Arguello's transition and struggle was documented in 2016 on this website, there she explains the need for an identity law and respect for the human rights of the trans population.

> Tijuana, BC-. Kendra Medina, a trans woman found dead inside her home on Wednesday morning at Hacienda Los Laureles, was possibly killed at the hands of someone she knew.
> 
> At 6:30 am on Wednesday, elements of the Tijuana Firefighters and Municipal Police officers went to the private Hacienda San Francisco, in said neighborhood, where the fire of house 1538-6 was reported. The firefighters put out the fire and upon entering one of the rooms, they found a body on the side of the bed, for which they notified the State Attorney General's Office.
> 
> Investigators found sufficient evidence to rule out that the person, named [deadname] Medina González and known as Kendra González, 26, died from the fire. The victim was dressed in a gray towel, with adhesive tape around the head, hands tied, two injuries to the lip and a mark in the neck allegedly caused by strangulation. ""The cause of death is likely to be asphyxia by strangulation, but we are waiting for the Forensic Medical Service to confirm this"" added the Central Prosecutor.
> 
> According to investigators, the alleged perpetrator could be someone close to Kendra as no evidence was found to indicate that entry into the home was forced or that she was the victim of arobbery. ""The body does not seem burned, we observe that they intended to set fire to the room where she was, but did not succeed"" said Sánchez Zamora.

Kendra was native to Nayarit, but had lived in Baja California for some time, working in a [maquiladora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maquiladora).

When released for burial her body showed signs of violence that had not been there when she was arrested.

> On Sunday, July 18, at 7 am, Fátima Belén Barrios, a 29-year-old transgender girl , died at the Guadalupe neighborhood police station in Formosa province.
>
> According to the police report, Fátima Belén and a friend were arrested that night after the owner of the rental where they lived, denounced them ""for causing disorder and damage to the property and a vehicle"" of the same. According to the police report, at the police station she suffered a decompensation, and when medical personnel of the Provincial Integrated System of Emergencies and Catastrophes (SIPEC) arrived, Fatima no longer had vital signs.
>
> Faced with uncertainty about the cause of death, family members and various organizations met in front of the police station to hold a press conference where her mother declared: “They told me that my daughter died of an overdose but before that they told me that she was pretending, that she did not want to give her information. I am sure that she was beaten to death”. A friend of Fatima who was with her when she was arrested added: ""Fatima left without any signs of blows, but in the drawer [at the morgue] her forehead was flattened.""
> 
> In dialogue with SUDAKA TLGBINB Agency, Patricia González, a reference for the Free and Diverses group from Formosa, said: “The report was labeled as an overdose, but her mother told us that she had marks on her head and neck, they only had her body for one hour"". ""When the police brought the body to my house, they told us that we could only be with her for two hours and immediately they took her away to bury. They told us that this was the way to proceed due to the pandemic.""
>
> ""They gave us the body all beaten, her nose was broken, blows to the forehead, knee and the whole body bloody. They put her in a black bag inside the drawer and they didn't want us to open the bag. But we did it anyway and we saw the blows,"" Fatima's mother added.


The police in the area have a record of covering up hate crimes against trans women.

> In Formosa we have to mourn a new death of a trans woman and at the hands of the police of Insfrán, who already has to her credit several transgressions, deaths of minors, and cover-ups of hate crimes as was the case of [Erika Rojas](https://tdor.translivesmatter.info/reports/2016/04/01/erika-rojas_formosa-argentina_946f8d3f) in 2016, which was ""resolved"" covered with doubts between the actions of the police and justice.
>
> We demand the urgent investigation of the case. We ask for justice for Fatima Belén. No more hate crimes.

>
> Fatima was taken from her home to the sub precinct yesterday Sunday morning on complaints from neighbors. Then when his family approached claiming detention, police informed him that he was dead. Fatima's body was full of blows and cuts by relatives.
>
> We call for investigation of Fatima's transfemicide and once again condemn the constant police attacks suffered by sex workers, mainly members of the [trans] community, and against the validity of articles criminalizing sex work and regulations that expose us to hiding.

> Enough of the transfemicides
>
> Enough of the police violence

> 
> Just weeks before her passing, Alex spoke out against the “medical negligence” she experienced after undergoing gender-affirming surgery at a private hospital in June 2020. The botched operation left her suffering from “indescribable” pain, she said in an interview with The Cue.
> 
> “Even when I stand for a longer time, sneeze, laugh or even brush my teeth, I have severe discomforts,” she said. “I have also been experiencing breathing difficulties.”
>
> More than a year after the operation, the pain she experienced was so severe she was unable to work. There is no money,” she said, adding: “I speak boldly because I want to live.”
> 
> Anannyah Kumari  Alex spoke of how many trans Indians are forced to cobble together the funds for gender-affirming surgery through sex work and begging.
> 
> “But after that, when this is the result they get,” she said, “what are they supposed to do? “Why are marginalised people like us being attacked like this for money?”

> “I’m a victim of gross negligence,” she added. “I want justice. I hope you all stand with me.”
> 
> After her passing, loved ones and fellow activists lodged a complaint to the chief minister seeking an inquiry into her death. Health minister Veena George and social justice minister R Bindhu ordered police to conduct a probe Wednesday.

In June 2020 Anannyah had undergone a botched gender confirmation surgery at a private hospital and had been in extreme pain ever since.

> Days before her death, Alex told a media outlet called The Cue that she became a victim of “gross medical negligence” during her gender confirmation surgery in June 2020 at a private hospital called Renai Medicity. “My private part looks like a piece of meat,” she said in a video interview. “I want to conduct a resurgery. I want justice.”
> 
> Saadiya, who is Kerala’s first trans woman TV journalist, added that she herself got her gender confirmation surgery five years ago, but recovered in time. “Anannyah had to change her sanitary napkin at least eight times a day due to fluids and bleeding.” 
> 
> Alex had been speaking up about her gender confirmation surgery experience for several months, on social media and news outlets. In one news interview with the regional publication Mathrubhumi, Alex said the Renai Medicity doctors “slashed [her] body here and there”. 
> 
> In yet another interview, she said she couldn’t stand, sneeze, laugh, brush her teeth or even breathe properly. “The money for the surgeries are painstakingly made by many through sex work, pooling from here and there, and even begging,” she had said. “Why are marginalised people like us being attacked like this for money?”

She lived with an evangelical birth family who did not respect her identity and had done whatever they could to obstruct her transition.

As Orgulho Transgênero said in a Facebook post (which is reproduced in full below) ""*She didn't just die of covid, she died from having to live trapped in an extremely hostile environment, cruel to extremely damaging transphobia, with no support to have a professional career without support of any nature without support becoming independent of the business of that transphobic family.*""

> TRANSPHOBIA KILLS!
> 
> Bru Waldorf was from an evangelical and transphobic middle class family, who didn't respect the fact that she was a trans woman, they never supported her and even at the time of her death the parent doesn't respect her, with revolting Facebook post as if she didn't it was the female type.
> 
> She had already posted how oppressed she was by a family that never supported who she was, a total cowardice with her dignity. She couldn't even try to change her name and gender on her birth certificate and documents because her parents wouldn't accept it.
> 
> She already posted showing desperation for finding a job that respected her social name, because it was a very oppressive family. They've already thrown it in her face that she was sustained but if they had supported the fact that they had a trans daughter and supported her in a professional career she could have a job and be independent.
> 
> Apparently the place of his residence also operated an inn, business of the evangelical pastor progenitor, businessman and a cowardly and transphobic inhuman. With family business, it was a very dangerous environment for contamination.
> 
> She didn't just die of covid, she died from having to live trapped in an extremely hostile environment, cruel to extremely damaging transphobia, with no support to have a professional career without support of any nature without support becoming independent of the business of that transphobic family. They killed her. Lately she couldn't even go out once a month like before because of the pandemic and living in an environment like this, had a very big psychological impact on her. But the transphobic business let the pandemic indoors.
> 
> The genocidal Jair who is also a disgusting transphobic and scoundrel should also be held responsible for not buying the vaccines as soon as he could.
> 
> The fundamentalist religion so called Christian, the religion of parents is also to blame for this because it has always fostered transphobia, criminal LGBTphobia and are one of those responsible for putting criminal genocidal in the presidency.
> 
> Transphobia kills, transphobia burns people alive, leads people to depression, suicide, excludes from society, kicked out of the house. And when you don't kick out like Bru's case, you keep trans people being tortured in a terrible environment like what she lived through.
> 
> I have no empathy with transphobic killers. These murderers transphobic scoundrels of her parents would die, but that she was alive and well. But most times bad vase doesn't break.
> 
> Unlike these transphobic scoundrels, Bru, or Bruna, as she wanted, for me and for many friends and friends will be remembered as she really is, an amazing, amazing woman. I've cried a lot and the crying will be until when I die. You will forever be loved my dear friend.
