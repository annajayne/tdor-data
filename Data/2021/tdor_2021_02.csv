Lucho Ávila,25,,2021_02_01_Lucho-Avila.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/larosanaranja.ac/photos/a.245326326030670/883983428831620/,1-Feb-2021,,Servicio Penitenciario Bonaerense Unidad 33,,Los Hornos,Buenos Aires,Argentina,-34.96741498,-57.96751084,custodial,died in custody,"Lucho died in custody in the women's prison where he had been held without trial for two and a half years for an alleged drugs offence.

> Lucho Ávila was barely 25 years old and it was his first time in a prison. He had been a prisoner for 2 years and 6 months in a cis women's prison, held without conviction or trial, for an alleged crime of possession of drugs for commercialization. He suffered from panic attacks, and after being punished in a practice known as 'mailbox', he committed suicide. His companions are asking for justice.
> 
> ""I wanted to provide information about what is happening in the women's prison No. 33 of Los Hornos, this time it is not an inmate dance,"" reads a text posted by inmates on different walls and Facebook groups. Despite the fact that this Penitentiary Unit made the news months ago for a reggaeton dance starring women deprived of their liberty and agents of the Buenos Aires Penitentiary Service (SPB), the silence in the national media was overwhelming after the suicide of Lucho Ávila, on Monday 1 February. In fact the news barely transcended social networks. According to her companions and as revealed by the Provincial Commission for Memory (CPM), Lucho, 25, suffered from panic attacks. And although there are conflicting versions about how it was that he got to the mailbox - a practice of prison punishment that consists of total isolation - the truth is that on Saturday, January 30, the confinement intensified despite his medical condition. Two days later Lucho hanged himself with some sheets, around 11 in the morning. Although CPR maneuvers were performed and he was transferred to a health unit, he died on the way.
> 
> ""He was not a violent person, he did not consume drugs, we always played sports and each one had her job,"" Camila, his political cousin and friend, also detained in that unit, told SOY. Like other of her classmates, who preferred not to reveal her identity, the pronouns she uses to talk about Lucho vary and change randomly as the talk progresses. “I talked to him a lot, he said he was tired for the cause: he went two years and six months without a sentence, I was one year and four months the same. He always spoke to her and told her to defend her innocence. He was a super educated and average person who had gotten used to being here, instead of fighting for his innocence, ""he said. Born and raised in Lanús, Lucho was in custody with preventive detention for an alleged violation of the Narcotics Law, more precisely for possession of drugs for commercialization. According to CELS data updated to 2017, in women's prisons 43.6% of detainees are imprisoned for this reason.
> 
> “In the stories it appears that he was actually doing a psychological and psychiatric treatment, we are aware of that. Every week there was a situation that they were addressing, ”Antonella Mirenghi, director of Inspections in places of confinement in the Committee against Torture of the CPM, told SOY. Like Camila, the official noticed that Lucho had been asking to work in an area other than the one assigned to him by the SPB: “He was very tired because of this issue, since he was supposedly given tasks for men. Carrying heavy bags of potatoes or meat, a very masculinized task. And he didn't like that, he felt bad. But beyond that, the important thing is: how do you take a person who has been undergoing psychological and psychiatric treatment for panic attacks to a place of punishment like that? ""
> 
> The lawyer described the mailboxes as “practically a place prepared to kill oneself: the 24-hour confinement in a perverse and dark place, where you can see how the system 'invites you', so to speak. Regarding the approach to suicide prevention, although there is a protocol, the reality is that it is not applied ”. Although he clarified that UP No. 33, unlike other prisons, does not tend to have overmedicalization practices, ""yes, there is a lack of care,"" as in most prisons.

Duda's family were supportive of her transition. The article [No Dia da Mulher, conheça a história de Duda Santos, trans executada a tiros em Itajaí](https://ndmais.com.br/justica-sc/no-dia-da-mulher-conheca-a-historia-de-duda-santos-transexual-executada-a-tiros-em-itajai/) (""On Women's Day, get to know the story of Duda Santos, shot and killed in Itajaí"") - published on International Women's Day - tells a little of her story.

> Duda Santos, 19, was the daughter of Jozias and Marli dos Santos, a Christian and traditional couple from Porto União (SC). Ever since she was little, she dreamed of being independent and free. She took his first steps towards her autonomy when, at the age of 16, she decided to [transition and] assume her real identity.
>
> Her transition was accepted by her family, who, without hesitation, resignified the relationship of affection, empathy and respect for their daughter.
>
> “With Duda, we learned a lot about the real meaning of Christian love that we talk about so much. I confess that it was delicate because we never had someone close who had experienced something similar. But over these three years, there were countless discoveries and learnings”, says Jenifer dos Santos, Duda's older sister.
>
> At the age of 18, Duda decided to leave her hometown to live her own life in Itajaí, on the North Coast of Santa Catarina .
>
> “She decided to move out of our city because she dreamt big, wanted to be independent and [undergo breast augmentation]. She decided, and at 18 she went to live”, remembers Jenifer.
>
> Unfortunately, Duda's new life on the North Coast of the State lasted just over a year. On February 2, she was brutally murdered with five point-blank shots at Rua Doutor Reinaldo Schmithausen, in the Cordeiros neighborhood, in Itajaí.

A month earlier she had undergone a cosmetic procedure which may have caused the condition that killed her.

> Forensics have determined that the cause of death of Giselle Sakai, who was found dead yesterday afternoon in her apartment in Manaíra, was a pulmonary embolism. The transsexual woman felt ill and asked for help from a friend who only arrived at the apartment about an hour and a half after her call. She found her dead.
> 
> Approximately a month ago Giselle had undergone liposuction, but according to her friend Karina Espínola Guedes, the procedure had [appeared to] cause no complications.
> 
> A hypothesis that could explain the embolism would be the use of industrial silicone for cosmetic purposes, a common practice in the routine of [trans women].
> 
> The National Health Surveillance Agency (Anvisa) prohibits the use of industrial silicone in cosmetic procedures. The product should not be used on the human body and is intended for cleaning cars and airplane parts, waterproofing tiles, sealing glass, among other uses. However, the deviation from its correct use, serving as material for plastic surgery, for example, is considered a crime and can cause serious health risks.
> 
> Whether at the time of application or over the years, the product can cause deformations, pain, difficulty walking, generalized infection, pulmonary embolism and even death.

> Members of LGBT groups protest in the main square September 14; They demand justice for Alessandra, a young trans woman murdered last Saturday.

Alessandra was from Montero in the department of Santa Cruz and had arrived in Cochabamba to work, accompanied by several colleagues. She was reportedly planning to stay in the city for just three days. Following her death Alesandra's birth family refused to bring her body home for burial when the activist Raiza Torriani tried to help organise it.

> According to the activist [Raiza Torriani], the family has limited resources. Alessandra grew up with her grandparents because her mother has a disability. Her grandmother passed away and the young woman was left in charge of her grandfather. After disclosing her [gender], the family rejected Alessandra, who left her home.
>
> At first, the family made a collection to try to transfer her body to Santa Cruz, however, they abandoned the idea.
>
> “Yesterday I communicated with the uncle and unfortunately he told me that during a family meeting they had decided not to bring her [body] back to Santa Cruz and that the money that the family had collected to able to move her body will be returned as the family are unhappy because, 'he had decided to be that way'. I have now seen [their] psychological and emotional violence"", she indicated.

As a result of their rejection, Alessanda's funeral was organised by her true family - her friends and community.

> No family member came to the cemetery and it was learned that Alessandra came from Montero, in Santa Cruz, where she has poor relatives. Torriani insisted that ""they rejected her"", so she finally ended her days accompanied only by her trans companions.

> The missing person for whom police were searching the past week has reportedly died, the Tippecanoe County Coroner's office confirmed after identifying a corpse found in Lafayette Tuesday afternoon.
> 
> Lafayette man Alex VanDalsen, 21, was deceased when found by police on the 2000-block of Breckenridge Street in Lafayette around 1 p.m. Tuesday, according to Lafayette Police Department logs.
> 
> Pride Lafayette, a group that advocates for LGBTQ people in Greater Lafayette, started a Facebook fundraiser in an effort to raise money for VanDalsen's funeral expenses on Wednesday. VanDalsen was a transgender man, according to his Facebook page.
> 
> The petition, which as of Wednesday evening had raised over $3,200 from nearly 100 people, can be found on Facebook on a page titled ""Alexander's Funeral Expenses.""
> 
> ""We did not know Alex, but we do know that no mother should ever have to bury a child,"" wrote Ashley Smith, the fundraiser's creator. ""He was someone's child, someone's sibling, someone's grandchild.""
> 
> Police have not said whether VanDalsen was found with any injuries. An autopsy is scheduled for Thursday, according to the coroner.


Subsequently his death was ruled a suicide following an autopsy. However, his family dispute the verdict:

> On February 3, 2021, It was a cold Indiana evening with snow on the ground. Alex left home on foot before midnight without telling anyone where he was going. 
>
> He wouldn't be seen alive again. On February 9th, Alex was found dead. His death was ruled a suicide without any investigation. The family doesn't believe the suicide theory for the following reasons:
>
> Alex's hands weren't tested for gunpowder residue.
>
> The gun was found underneath his body and wasn't tested for fingerprints. 
>
> Alex was found 10 miles from his home. It was less than 20 degrees and he wasn't dressed for the weather. He also didn't take his car. So how did he get to the site where his body was found? Because of his asthma, the snow and low temperature, he didn't make the 10 mile walk. 
>
> There were no shell casings at the death scene. How was that possible? 
>
> There was no blood splatter at the scene.
>
> Jennifer VanDalsen (Alex's mother) believes someone picked Alex up, killed him and then dumped his body. However, she believes law enforcement refused to investigate the case seriously because Alex was transgender. 
>
> The family has asked law enforcement to answer their concerns about Alex's death. They haven't received any answers. Did Alex truly commit suicide or was he murdered?

> KANNUR: K Sneha [other sources say Sneha K], 34, the lone transgender woman who had contested in the recent local body elections in the state, died of burns following a self-immolation bid in front of her house at Thottada Samjwadi colony here on Tuesday night.
> 
> Sneha had stood as an independent candidate from Kizhunna ward of Kannur Corporation. Her candidature attracted wide media attention, especially during the campaigning period. 
> 
> According to eyewitnesses, she came out of her house at 10pm, poured kerosene over her head and set herself ablaze. Sneha, who lived with husband Rajesh and parents Suleiman and Kochamma, was employed in the construction sector.
> 
> She also worked in catering and was a member of the transgender Kudumbashree unit. Edakkad police, who have registered a case of unnatural death, said family issues were behind her extreme step. 

Sneha was a social activist who spoke loudly for the advancement of trans rights in India and fought for better living conditions and improvements to the infrastructure of her community.

> 
> Sneha described how the ward residents lived in unhygienic conditions, there were no proper drainage systems and the roads were decrepit. She said that after undergoing gender affirmation surgery in 2019, she felt more confident in herself. Sneha said she had put off the surgery for so long because of years of social neglect and stigma.
> 
> She said: “I feel more confident now, and I am sure that people will accept me and give me an opportunity to serve them.
> 
> “It is a beginning, and my effort to serve people will continue whether I win or not.”

> Néstor [deadname] Moreno Castillo, 32 years old, was assassinated at dawn this Thursday in the El Jazmín neighborhood sector in the avenida Colón de Calarcá area. They attacked her with a knife and from behind.
> 
> According to the information, people who were mobilizing around 4:00 in the morning found the victim lying on the floor and immediately notified the authorities who arrived at the site to find out what had happened.
> 
> Moreno Castillo was found with several stab injuries to his back. The scene of the events was cordoned off with the purpose of collecting evidence.

Note that her preferred social name is unclear (most sources say Néstor, but some refer to her as Andrea). Néstor was part of her birth name, but comments under a post by Red Comunitaria Trans suggest she was not inclined to change it after transition. If that was the case, it may be that ""Andrea Castillo"" was a name she experimented with but did not adopt.

As always when there is some uncertainty over naming, caution is advised. For now the name given on this report is a composite of both, but it will be updated if and when new information emerges.

Manuela was an aspiring journalist, producer and actress who had been forced to resort to sex work to support herself. Unlike many trans people, her family were supportive of her transition.

> About four years ago, Manuela decided to start the gender transition process. Contrary to the reality of many other trans people, the young woman had support and love from her family. 
>
> The victim's ex-companion, businessman Lucas Picanço, reported to Em Tempo that Manuela worked as an actress, organized events and had a children's theater company.
>
> ""We had already participated in several presentations here in Manaus. Manu was taking a course in administration and drawing. She was always looking to learn, and in fact, she studied journalism for a while,"" said Picanço.
> 
> If at home the young girl received all the affection from her family, outside the scenario was quite different, and Manuela was forced to face the contempt and prejudice of society.
>
> ""Manu didn't even like to go to the grocery store, because people always made jokes about her appearance, and that bothered her a lot,"" reported the businessman.
>
> The mistrust and indifference faced by Manuela were not restricted to laughter and prejudiced jokes. She had a hard time getting a job in a job market so hostile to [trans women].
>
> ""Without opportunities, Manuela often ended up taking risks and resorted to prostitution to supplement her income. She complained that getting job offers was always very difficult,"" said Picanço.

She was a Mapuche trans artist and activist who was trying to help defend indigenous land from encroachment.

> Emilia Milén Herrera Obrecht was shot in the head early Wednesday morning near the Riñi Mapu condominium in Panguipulli, a city in southern Chile. She was 25 years old and those around her called her ""Baucis"" [other sources say ""Bau""]. Not long ago she had started her transition within a Mapuche community. 
> 
> Emilia was shot in circumstances that are still being investigated by the Homicide Brigade and the Los Ríos Regional Crime Laboratory. Her death occurs less than two weeks after a video of the murder of Francisco Martínez, a street artist shot four times by a policeman's gun while resisting an identity check, went viral and sparked a wave of protests in several cities of Chile.
> 
> This is the same town where four years ago the environmental activist Macarena Valdés was found dead in her home in the Mapuche community of Newen de Tranguil. Although the official autopsy concluded her death was a suicide, her family continues to denounce it as a murder generated in the framework of a fight she commanded against a hydroelectric project by an Austrian company. 
> 
> A source who lives in the area and spoke with Presentes by phone - asking for their identity to be withheld for fear of reprisal - explained: what is happening in Panguipulli and the surrounding areas is the reflection of a division that has been brewing for years, with a marked inequality. In that southern city, they speak with emphasis of ""a lack of dialogue with native peoples, who have a historical struggle for territorial autonomy, and simply are not listened but repressed"" And that, they say, conflicts with the municipality and the authorities ""have also been growing for a long time, partly for these reasons."" 
> 
> The bullet that killed Emilia was fired on that stage. And in the midst of a conflict that reappears every year: the need to ""spend the summer"" and to reach beaches near private condominiums in Panguipulli, which block free access.

> A 25-year-old trans woman was abandoned inside a room at an aesthetic clinic in downtown São Paulo during a fire at the site last Wednesday (17), according to her husband, communicator Washington Barbosa.
> 
> Lorena Muniz was sedated to undergo a silicone implant surgery when the fire started. According to Washington Barbosa, Lorena inhaled smoke and was unconscious for seven minutes before being removed from the scene.
> 
> Lorena Muniz was taken to the Hospital das Clínicas and, according to the press office of the hospital, is hospitalized in serious condition in the emergency room of the unit.
> 
> In a post on social media, Washington said that the air conditioning unit at the beauty clinic caught fire and all the employees left, leaving Lorena unconscious in a room.
> 
> According to the Fire Department, three vehicles were activated on Wednesday (17) to contain a fire in a commercial building on Rua da Glória, in downtown São Paulo. In a statement, the corporation states that "" the fire spread and the victim, who was inside the site performing an aesthetic procedure, was rescued to the hospital .""

Shortly after Lorena's death the São Paulo City Council initiated a  Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry to investigate cases of violence against trans people.

> A plenary session of the São Paulo City Council approved on Tuesday (23) the creation of a Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry ( CPI ) to investigate cases of violence against transgender people in the city of São Paulo.
> 
> The approval took place in a symbolic way, after an agreement that had already been made in the College of Leaders, among the various parties of the house. The application was filed by city councilwoman Erika Hilton (PSOL).
> 
> The creation of CPI was driven by the death of [trans woman] Lorena Muniz, 25, who died after a fire in a clinic in the Center of SP where she was undergoing a silicone implant surgery. The clinic was not endorsed by firefighters to operate and Lorena was sedated at the time of the fire, which happened last Wednesday (17). She was rescued by firefighters and taken to Hospital das Clínicas, where she died.


After Lorena's death police opened an investigation into the ""doctor"" and clinic involved - which is also the subject of several lawsuits by other patients.

> The team responsible for the surgery of Lorena Muniz, a trans woman who died in February of inhaling smoke during a fire at the clinic where underwent [cosmetic surgery] in São Paulo, is the target of a police investigation and several lawsuits filed by other patients.
>
> Despite presenting himself as Dr. Paulino de Souza on social networks, the man who negotiates the surgeries with the patients  - and with whom Lorena agreed to undergo her procedure, according to her husband - is not registered as a doctor. In groups of trans women, Paulino is known for offering cheap plastic surgery and attracting patients from different places in Brazil.


In early May 2021 police opened a homicide investigation into Lorena's death. As a result, 6 people were indicted for involuntary homicide.

> The Public Ministry (MP) disagreed with the Civil Police of São Paulo and charged with unintentional homicide (without the intention of killing) the six people who were being investigated for the death of transsexual hairdresser Lorena Batista Muniz. The victim was 25 years old when she died of asphyxia five days after a fire in an aesthetic clinic, on February 17, in downtown São Paulo.
>
> The Prosecutor's complaint was sent to the Court, which, until the last update of this report, had not made a decision on the matter. If the accusation is accepted, a doctor, a nursing technician, two businessmen and two administrators will become defendants in the process that investigates the causes and responsibilities for the victim's death. They will respond to the crime of unintentionalhomicide. If convicted, the penalty is 1 to 3 years in prison.
>
> The 1st Police District (DP) in Sé, which investigated the Lorena Muniz case, had, however, indicted four people for intentional homicide for eventual intent (when the risk of killing is assumed) and two others for failure to help. In such cases, the punishment for intentional homicide varies between 6 and 20 years of imprisonment.
>
> Another difference between wrongful death and willful homicide is that the first is tried by a judge and the second, by seven jurors.
>
> Upon receiving the final report of the investigation, the Public Ministry decided that the accused had no intention of killing the patient, who was sedated when the fire reached the Clínica Saúde Aqui, in Liberdade.

The authorities refused to tell her family how she died.

> On Thursday February 26, Kim Wirtz's niece received a devastating call from the chaplain of the Baltimore City Central Booking Unit informing them that their Aunt, Kim a transgender woman, was found unresponsive in a single cell of a male prison at midnight. She was later pronounced dead at 1:16am at Mercy Hospital.
> 
> STILL AS OF NOW THEY HAVE NOT BEEN GIVEN A CAUSE OF DEATH & The jail refuses to give them any detailed report Of the ""incident"" until they acquire an attorney. Unfortunately, because of the untimeliness of Kim's death, they simply are not equipped to cover the cost and expenses of her arrangements let alone legal counsel.
> 
> TODAY WE DEMAND ANSWERS FOR THE FAMILY AND THE UNTIMELY DEMISE OF OUR FALLEN SISTER!!!!!
