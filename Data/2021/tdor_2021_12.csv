> The associations noted, ""With her body sent to the forensic medicine institution for an autopsy because 'her death was suspicious', Derya's death is not suspicious. It is without a doubt that Derya was the victim of a 'murder'. It is an undeniable fact that, in our geography, trans people unfortunately wage a fight in conditions of police state and state of emergency."" Raising concerns about the impunity for the crimes against trans people in Turkey, the associations have briefly added:
> 
> ""When the autopsy reports come out, we may well learn that Derya was not killed by someone, but hanged herself, which would not change the fact that Derya was the victim of a murder.
> 
>  Deprived of all types of social and public support mechanisms, systematically deprived of all constitutional rights, excluded from public space, turned into a target of organized evil and violence by the state as well and with their deceased bodies found in a field, a construction site, a car park or a highway not met 'with surprise or awe' by society, trans people's suicides, about the reasons of which we do not think much, but we all know, are murders, even if they are suicides.

She was a community leader who had asked for protection after being threatened. 

> Cristina Cantillo, the renowned leader and social activist of the LGBTI + community in Santa Marta, was murdered on Tuesday night while she was sitting on the terrace of her house [at Carrera 60 No. 10-60] in the Ondas del Caribe neighborhood.
> 
> The leader had received death threats and several attacks against her and her family, as a result of which the local government authorized her special protection through the National Protection Unit, UNP. Last year Castillo had asked for protection after suffering an attack in which her brother was injured.
> 
> Human rights defenders condemned her assassination and claimed that the social leader was not listened to by the local authorities. According to the Samarian leader Lerbes Dimas, city life is not respected and today a whole community mourns the loss of a feisty, affective woman with a social sense.
> 
> ""They turned off the voice of a leader, of a colleague. Cristina did not want to die and asked a thousand times for a security scheme different from the one she had. She had denounced the fact that they were going to assassinate her, but it was the voice of a trans woman, which no one wanted to hear"" Dimas expressed.
> 
> Cristina had reported serious extortion situations against trans women who worked in prostitution  in the Mamatoco sector, also serious complaints against the National Police. In her social networks, the activist had made a recent  publication in which she expressed solidarity with the families affected by the fire in the public market of Santa Marta that occurred at dawn this Tuesday.
> 
> According to the authorities, initial reports indicate that a hitman arrived at the door of Castillo's house and shot him several times. Despite being taken to a health center she died.

The same day two other trans people - [Maní](https://tdor.translivesmatter.info/reports/2021/12/07/mani_bogota-distrito-capital-colombia_40b6c010) and [La Divaza](https://tdor.translivesmatter.info/reports/2021/12/07/la-divaza_riohacha-la-guajira-colombia_67d53f66) - were also killed in Colombia.

In February 2022 Darinel José Posada Tovar was charged with her murder.

> Little more than two months after the murder of the LGBTI leader Cristina Cantillo , which occurred in December 2021 in Santa Marta, the Prosecutor's Office has charged the suspected hitman who entered her house and shot her.
>
> The suspect is Darinel José Posada Tovar, alias Duende, who was charged with the crimes of aggravated homicide and fabrication, carrying or aggravated possession of firearms and remanded in custody.
>
> Cantillo, a trans woman who defended the rights of the LGBTI population in Magdalena , was murdered around 9:30 at night on December 7, while she was with her relatives. That night a man entered her home, which was located in the Luis Carlos Galán neighborhood of that city, and shot her several times with a 9-millimeter pistol, fatally wounding her.
>
> According to the Prosecutor's Office, during the investigation, interviews were taken and photographic examinations carried out that allowed alias Duende to be identified as the alleged perpetrator of the crime. In addition, it was shown that the man was apparently a hitman for the criminal group 'los Pachenca', active in the department of Magdalena.

> A [trans woman] was stabbed to death at dawn this Thursday (9) on Avenida Edson Ramalho, in João Pessoa.
> 
> According to an investigation by TV Correio, the victim worked as a program girl in the locality. She was reportedly approached by someone who looked like a customer on Avenida João Maurício, on the edge of Praia de Manaíra. After some conversation, they walked to Avenida Edson Ramalho and stopped on a piece of land next to a container, a spot often used for sexual encounters.
> 
> There, the man started to attack the [trans woman]. She managed to run for a few meters but could not survive her injuries. The man fled towards the beach, and security camera footage recorded the moment he rushed past, with something in his hand that looked like a purse. The [trans woman]'s purse was found in the vicinity where the crime took place.

Subsequently it was alleged that her killing was orchestrated as a result of a feud with Aysla Roberta, 24.

> Audio recording sexchanged between Yasmin Fontes, 23, who was stabbed to death last Tuesday (8), and Aysla Roberta, 24, suspected of committing the crime, reveal a feud that already existed between the two trans women.
>
> Yasmin was murdered with a knife in the Manaíra neighborhood, being hit in the neck and chest. She could not survive her wounds and died at the scene. Local security cameras recorded the moment when the suspect ran away after committing the crime. 
>
> According to Yasmin's family, the victim and suspect already had an old feud and the family had access to audios in Whatsapp conversations where the two exchanged curses and threats, as reported by Notícia Paraíba.
>
> In the conversation, Yasmin tells a person that Aysla was looking for her and that she reportedly threatened to kill her. The trans woman also said that she came to run after suspicion during the confusion between the two, but that Aysla had drawn a dagger and told others that she would end Yasmin's life.
>
> In the audio sent by Aysla, she said she was fed up with the arguments and threatened to take five men to kill Yasmin.
>
> Aysla's defense attorneys said the trans woman is innocent and that the crime was not a murder but a robbery.
