He had disappeared on 16th May 2017.

> Yesterday afternoon, a man was occasionally driving along National Route 9 when he found skeletal remains on the side of the road, at kilometer 12.5 near the La Caldera river in the town of Vaqueros, Salta. He immediately called the police, who arrived shortly afterwards. Throughout the night, investigators worked under the hypothesis that it could be Santiago Cancinos, the 14-year-old trans boy who had been missing since May 16, 2017.
> 
> The confirmation came this Friday: from the Public Prosecutor's Office of Salta they communicated that the remains indeed belong to the minor, of whom nothing had been heard for more than four years.
> 
> The criminal prosecutors Mónica Poma and Santiago López Soto and the director of the CIF, Pablo Rivero, indicated that the dental expertise determined a 100% match. The same was carried out with the dental records of Cancinos, granting certainty of his identity. On the other hand, some articles of clothing, despite their deteriorated condition, were recognized by the teenager's parents. In the next few days a genetic comparison will be carried out in order to finish verifying his identity.
> 
> In the statement, prosecutors referred to the minor by his birth name, [deadname] Cancinos. This is how it appeared on the website of the Missing Children organization and also on the official page of disappeared persons of the national government, which came to offer a reward of one and a half million pesos for anyone who provided information on their whereabouts. Prosecutors clarified that he was mentioned according to his legal name at the time of the disappearance, without ignoring the validity of the Gender Identity Law, in relation to his self-perception. For Javier Cancino, Santiago's father, the name was indifferent: he just wanted to find his son.
> 
> The discovery took place in an area that is very difficult to access, since it is a slope of more than 80 degrees and covered by weeds. It is located a few kilometers from the Bicentennial Park, where the minor had been last seen.
> 
> On the afternoon of May 16, 2017, Cancinos said goodbye to his father to go to a physical education class at the Belgrano school in the capital of Salta. The man offered to take him to school in the car, located relatively close to the house, in the macro-center of the capital of Salta. Santiago said no, he wanted to go on his own. The father insisted but there was no case. They greeted each other and were never together again.

Despite the organization 100% Diversidad y Derechos requesting that the prosecutor continue the investigation under the hypothesis of a hate crime, Santiago's death was ruled a suicide and the case closed in early July 2021:

> The judicial investigation into the death of Santiago Cancinos, the 14-year-old trans adolescent from Salta whose remains were found on June 4 in a rugged area of the town of Vaqueros after four years of searching, was closed yesterday as a suicide by the Prosecutor's Office.
>
> ""The case has already been closed and the remains were handed over to the parents because it was concluded that it was a suicide and that there was no crime,"" a source from the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Province of Salta told Télam.
>
> Tests carried out on the remains found allowed investigators ""to rule out signs of violence"" and, although the mechanics of the death could not be determined, the hypothesis is that it was by hanging with a rope found at the scene alongside the belongings of the adolescent.
>
> Investigators concluded that Santiago took his life on the same day of his disappearance - May 16, 2017 - and in the same place where his remains were found.

The 36-year-old trans activist knew Thomas personally. She explained that the area where Thomas’ body was found is “very dangerous.” She, too, is restlessly waiting on autopsy results.
> 
> “They didn’t need to dispose of her like trash,” Lopez added. “She did not get there by accident. She was either murdered or she got there because we failed her. You don’t ignore a person who died and whose body is disposed of in the street.”

> Thomas’ family described her as a “happy,” “beautiful,” and “sweet soul” who “loved all her family deeply.” Most of all, Thomas was a bombastic storyteller, loved ones said. ""You could hear her talk all day,"" Rucker said. ""She got the gift of gab, you just don't know.""
> 
> Thomas grew up in the Bronx’s Forest Houses projects. “She liked to dance, she liked to sing, and she loved to do hair, too, and make up,” Brazier added. “She loved all that.” Thomas transitioned in her 20s, her family said. “From a child, she knew who she was,” Brazier added. “She was always curious, asked a lot of questions. Wanted to know everything.”

> On 6 June a 13-year-old gender questioning [teenager] was found lifeless by their mother, who for months had reported to the school that her child was being bullied because of their gender identity. In fact, Noah (invented name) did not seem to live serenely the changes in their body during adolescence, so they decided to cut their hair and use a gender-neutral name.
> 
> The mother and her lawyer, who both [misgendered] the child, are convinced that the anxiety and depression that had been diagnosed in Noah were the result of their treatment by friends who, from the moment of Noah's first awareness of their own gender identity, had isolated them and called them [deadname].
> 
> In an email sent to the head teacher last November, the woman had expressed her concern. ""Unfortunately, even after the class change, the same problems continue to exist - my [child] was targeted by a small group of girls mainly for [their] physicality, an object of derision and chatter that seems to have spread to other classes as well. My [child] is starting to take it out on [themself]. We need your attention and your help, I can't do it alone”.

> So why did it take so long to learn about her murder?
> 
> A police report initially listed her as a “John Doe,” despite her having legally changed her name and gender marker and a policy requiring police to report the authentic names of transgender people. The Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner’s office has Lewis listed under the male name she was given at birth – despite the fact her name was legally changed, which was reflected on her state identification card.
> 
> A spokesman for the medical examiner’s office said that fingerprints identified Lewis as Tierramarie, her chosen name, however, on her death certificate, a document prepared by a funeral home, the family provided a different name and that became the official record linked to her death.

> On Monday, June 14, 23-year-old Black trans man EJ Boykin also known as Novaa Watson died in Lynchburg, Virginia from a gunshot wound. From The News & Advance:
> 
> ""Officers responded to the parking lot outside the Family Dollar on Fort Avenue at about 6 p.m. Monday for reports of a malicious wounding, LPD previously said in a news release. There, they found a person the police department identified as 23-year-old [EJ] Boykin, of Lynchburg, suffering from a gunshot wound. Boykin was taken to Lynchburg General Hospital for treatment of serious injuries and died soon after.""
>
> Law enforcement and family describe EJ using male pronouns, but the media is still using his deadname. They claim he never used a different name. Friends disagree. EJ used Novaa Watson on social media.
>
> Torri Chippe said she’s been friends with Boykin, who’s been called “Novaa” or “EJ” by friends, since middle school. “He was loved and like[d] by everyone,” she said in a message. “He was one of those people that was just good vibes and energy.”
>
> EJ was born and raised in Baltimore, Maryland but recently lived in Lynchburg. EJ was studying at Morgan State University. It appears EJ was the parent of a young child, who may have been present at the scene of the shooting, but was uninjured. EJ just celebrated his 23rd birthday on June 10. My heart breaks for the child(ren) involved – losing a parent, witnessing a shooting – whether they were the same child or not.

She died in hospital.

Subsequently a 64 year old man handed himself in to the authorities.

> According to the Caldas Police report a fight caused the death of a 24-year-old person, a member of the Lgtbi community in Chinchiná. The alleged perpetrator surrendered to the authorities yesterday. The victim was Shirley Mejía Sánchez, a 24-year-old trans woman.
> 
> The incident occurred at the El Faro residencia on Saturday night. According to the initial investigation, a conflict arose between an older adult and another person. The victim apparently tried to mediate or defend another and received an injury to the abdomen, which compromised her vital organs. Although she was taken alive to the San Marcos Hospital she died while receiving medical attention.
> 
> The authorities began investigations, which suggest that in the moments before the assault the adult complained about the alleged loss of his wallet and accused someone other than Shirley. Tempers heated up, and it is presumed that Shirley came between the attacker and another colleague (who was also from the LGBT community) before suffering the fatal stabbing. This is the seventh homicide case this year in the town - five of them in June.
> 
> This media learned that yesterday afternoon the alleged perpetrator of the murder surrendered himself voluntarily to the authorities. It was indicated that the Sijín had identified him and progress was being made to request the arrest warrant. That pressure led the 64-year-old man to go to the Prosecutor's Office, who summoned him to charge him.

> The body of a transsexual woman was found along Via Prenestina in Rome. The discovery was made earlier today, Tuesday 22 June and took place in the Quarticciolo area, near viale Palmiro Togliatti.
>
> At about 7.40 am, a report was made of a lifeless body inside a water drainage channel at street number 486, at the intersection with via Conversano, by a passerby who stopped a patrol of the Compagnia di Roma Montesacro passing through the area and requested an ambulance. The local carabinieri intervened at the scene, but unfortunately there was nothing for the woman to do except to note her death, which was confirmed by the 118 health workers who arrived by ambulance. Soldiers of the Investigative Unit of via in Selci also arrived to conduct scientific surveys and collect evidence.
> 
> The coroner and the magistrate on duty arrived on viale Palmiro Togliatti today for the first on-site checks. Those who investigated and carried out the first checks on the body found a wound on the forehead, which does not exclude any hypothesis, including murder. Subsequent post-mortem examinations will clarify the causes that led to the death. At the moment little information is known, the investigators are at work and it is not clear how the body got inside the canal, if anyone abandoned it and then left. Every hypothesis is currently being examined and the investigators are not revealing any further information but do not exclude any leads.


The subsequent autopsy concluded that Adrieli was killed.

If it is no longer a mystery  how  she died, now the mystery is about who killed Adrieli that night. As reported by La Repubblica  for days, the Carabinieri have been engaged in investigations: they listen to the woman's friends, other young trans girls and [sex workers] who could provide clues. However, so far there is no suspect. 
>
> Adrieli, who was of South American origin, was found on the morning of last June 22, in a canal of the Quarticciolo - a few steps from the Prenestina. The hypothesis of robbery was immediately ruled out, since the young Adrieli had twenty euros with her in her purse, but not her cell phone. Could it be that the phone contains important clues? 
>
> However, it is now the turn of the autopsy now to speak: bruises and scratches were found on her body - signs of an assault. Perhaps the young woman was attacked by her own client or by another person. The head wound - identified when the body was found - could also be consistant with a blow from a stick. In short, someone Adrieli killed her now it is up to the military to reconstruct what happened and who is responsible.

A 16-year-old teenager was apprehended for an offense analogous to murder. Through anonymous reports, the civil and military police found Manoel Moreira Freire Neto, 22, with a history of theft, and the teenager, with offenses such as vehicle theft, reception and illegal possession of a firearm. They were taken to the Paracuru Municipal Police Station.
> 
> According to the Police, there are signs that the behavior of those captured is related to transphobia. The searches were initiated after the victim's death was registered, on Tuesday morning, 22. According to police chief Sâmella Saraiva, head of the Metropolitan Police Station of Paracuru, traces and statements were collected that confirmed the presence of the suspects at the scene of the crime. “The two showed coolness when talking about the crime, especially the teenager, who told details about the action. In addition, the body was found with injuries resulting from blunt and sharp objects, after a discussion between those involved and the victim”, he says.

They were a software developer known for developing emulators and conserving retro videogames.

> “Near took their own life”. That’s how a news article would phrase it. Suicide is a voluntary action, a problem with oneself. Implying nobody is to blame but the victim and perpetrator, one and the same.
>
> But that’s not how human brains work. We are not cold, calculating machines. We are a product of our environment. We are shaped by our experiences. A single, powerful traumatic event can change a person forever. So can a million small ones. This is not a weakness of the mind, it is a fundamental part of what it means to be human.
>
> Near was a brilliant mind in a corner of the web all too often rife with toxicity and harassment. Despite this, they continued to pour their life into the one thing they loved: emulation and retro gaming. Developer of the bsnes, higan, and ares emulators, Near was a relentless force for accuracy in the formerly haphazard world of emulation. Working out the most elusive hardware glitches and corner cases, they advanced the world of SNES emulation by leaps and bounds. They also recently released their ultimate labor of love, a fan translation of Bahamut Lagoon that might well be the most exacting and meticulously crafted language adaptation of a video game of the era.
>
> Near was also an incredibly kind, funny, and welcoming person. I’d known them for several years, but after they moved to Tokyo a few years back we started talking more often. One of the most modest people I’ve ever known, they were unlikely to suggest hanging out in person, but never rejected an offer. I wish I’d done that more often. We’ve had long text conversations, and shared many stories.
>
> Near did not commit suicide. Near was murdered. Victim of a lifetime of harassment. After an abusive childhood, and followed by community toxicity, Near was eventually targeted by Kiwi Farms. Members of that website make a sport of preying on the less fortunate, on those in positions liable to being emotionally abused. And they do so relentlessly. From the comfort of anonymity, of sitting in front of their computer thousands of kilometers away, they take glee in slowly destroying the psyche of others, bit by bit. To death, if possible.
>
> Near survived that. Many wouldn’t, but Near was strong enough to overcome that level of emotional abuse. But Kiwi Farms is relentless. Not to be defeated in their pursuit of utter emotional and psychological destruction, they went after who Near treasured most: their friends. Doxing some, directly harassing others, and even specifically seeking out suicidal people to target.
>
> That broke Near.
>
> After falling down a spiral of depression and eventually breaking off contact with everyone last year, I feared for the worst. Eventually, they were luckily able to get help and found medication that helped them cope with the psychological scars of abuse in late 2020. I first heard from Near again in late October 2020, and we again started having chats. It seemed things were getting better.
>
> Unfortunately, medication can be a fickle beast. It didn’t work forever. The looming threat of Kiwi Farms, of their power to destroy not just Near but also their friends, caused them daily anxiety that just wouldn’t go away. Worried that their friends would feel burdened by their condition again, Near decided to avoid the subject. I only found out about this relapse today.
>
> To the people of Kiwi Farms, this is a videogame. That the people on the other side of the screen are real makes no difference. They delight in the kill counter going up just like an FPS player would. Lacking in any empathy, they have no regard for the damage they inflict on others.

She died while receiving medical attention.

> A case of transphobia was registered in Tunja, Boyacá , this Monday, June 28, on International LGBTIQ + Pride Day. Adriana Díaz, a trans woman, was attacked at dawn by a mob.
> 
> The case was made known by the Gaat Foundation (Trans Action and Support Group) through its social networks. A video published by the organization shows that around 20 people hit Adriana with sticks and other blunt objects while she lay wounded on the ground.
> 
> Police say the victim was accused of allegedly trying to rob a taxi driver, which caused a disproportionate and violent reaction from other drivers. The police statement indicates that, around 5 am this Monday, they received a report about a person who ""had taken a taxi service at the height of the old Tunja Transport Terminal"" that ""was trying to rob a driver of a public service vehicle.""
> 
> The driver, the police say, ""requested support from the drivers union and a taxi driver came to help him.""That man ""was injured with a sharp weapon"" and, presumably, ""the current mortal victim was the one who attacked him"". Witnesses say that around 30 drivers arrived at the scene, brutally attacking the woman. Activists and authorities agree that  nothing justifies the attacks she suffered .
> 
> According to the Police, when the officers reached the point of the events, they found Adriana Díaz badly injured after being punched, kicked and beaten with objects. ""She had several injuries including trauma to the face and in various parts of the body. All were caused by blunt objects"" said Commander Bello, who added that they requested the assistance of an ambulance, but, given the seriousness of her injuries, they decided to transfer the woman in a police vehicle to the Tunja Metropolitan Hospital. Due to the delicate condition presented by Adriana, she was referred to the Hospital San Rafael de Tunja. ""When she was receiving medical assistance, she died as a result of her injuries,"" says Colonel Bello.
> 
> However in its complaint, Gaat alleges that Adriana Díaz was not treated in the hospital centers because she was a trans person and her immigration status had not been resolved. ""Access to health care for trans people in Colombia is difficult, it is a subject of constant revictimizations. In the same way, with the irregular migrant population,"" said Andra Hernández, from the Gaat legal team who personally followed up on this case. Neither the Hospital Metropolitano de Tunja nor the Hospital San Rafael de Tunja have commented on the matter.
