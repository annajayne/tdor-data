She had fled to Swabi to escape her non-accepting 

> Born to a conservative family in the small village of Merozai in the Kohat district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Dolphin had spent some eighteen summers of her life living as [deadname], the withdrawn but still conforming son of Waheed Ahmed.
> 
> Farhan’s family, which had been seeing his transformation from afar, could never be the one to come to terms with it. Over the years, their disapprovals grew bolder and fiercer. Confrontations became more violent and soon, the youth was left with no option but to flee for [her] life.
> 
> The mask of [deadname] was left and put to rest in Merozai. What came to Swabi was a self-accepting transgender woman who would soon come to be known as Dolphin. Here, she’d find the opportunity to express herself in the way she’d always seen fit. She’d find a community and the many liberties she could never imagine having in her stifling hometown of Kohat. No one knew Farhan Ahmed here. It was just Dolphin and she was free to live her life.  However, even when fleeing home, young Dolphin knew the ire of her blood would one day hound her down. Which is why all her visits to Kohat were carried out in great secrecy. Out of the same fear, she would stay at a relative’s house instead of her own and make all efforts to stay off of her immediate family’s radar.
>
> Things took a turn for the grave on March 1, when information of Dolphin’s visit to Kohat was somehow leaked to her family. Soon, her body was discovered from a dump in an area known locally as Mirzai. She had been murdered in cold blood just a few hours after arriving in her hometown. A First Information Report was lodged with the Kohat Police for Dolphin’s murder, upon request of her father Waheed Ahmed.
> 
> “At first, we had nothing which offered any explanation of the youth’s mysterious murder. But later, investigations revealed that [Dophin]’s family was strictly against [her] identifying as a transgender person. The most irked of kin would be [her] brother, who found [Dolphin] attending local dance parties in the guise of a woman, a jab to his own self-respect,” told Kohat District Police Officer Sohail Khalid.
> 
> Upon suspicion, Dolphin’s brother Rehman was soon booked for questioning. The accused confessed shooting Dolphin out of spite, during preliminary interrogation. Following which, the murder weapon was recovered and taken into police custody. “I was hurt. The embarrassment of my brother choosing to turn into a Khwaja Sira was too much,” Rehman told the police.

*[Editor's Note: Dolphin's murder was not included on the TDoR 2021 memorial list released by Transgender Europe (TGEU) in November 2021]*

>
> The child's mother was the one who found him when he arrived at his home, in what appeared to have been a hanging.
>
> He was a trans boy who was waiting to complete the administrative procedures for his new identity document, so initially the police actions carried another name referring to his expired ID, and provided erroneous information about his gender.
>
> Scientific Police experts are working at the site to reliably determine the cause of death and rule out evidence of criminality. The house does not show signs of force or violence, so everything points to support the hypothesis of suicide in this tragic episode.
>
> We want to highlight the lack of gender perspective of the media, this note had to be presented to exert pressure by the lgbtiq community on the media and elsewhere. Throughout Argentina, the security forces and justice lack a gender perspective, it is very regrettable to act without measuring consequences when making a correct evaluation of self-identified genders.

A year earlier she had been expelled from the South Korean army after undergoing gender confirmation surgery.

> South Korea‘s first transgender soldier Byun Hee-soo has been found dead at her home, and the cause of death is not yet known.
> 
> According to South Korean news agency Yonhap, a mental health counsellor in Byun Hee-soo’s neighbourhood in Cheongju, south of Seoul, called emergency services to report that Byun had not been reachable since Sunday (28 February), and firefighters found her dead at her house at 5.49pm on Wednesday (3 March), according to police officers.
> 
> The local mental health care clinic said Byun Hee-soo attempted suicide three months ago, according to Yonhap. No suicide note was found, and police are investigating the death.
> 
> Byun, who was a tank gunner in Gyeonggi province, north of Seoul, was discharged from the army after undergoing gender affirmation surgery in January last year. She launched a landmark legal challenge against the South Korean army over her dismissal, but this was rejected in July.
> 
> Byun Hee-soo’s case triggered a debate about the treatment of the LGBT+ community, trans troops and LGBT+ soldiers in the conservative country. The Centre for Military Human Rights Korea (CMHRK) had urged the South Korean military not to discharge Byun because she could “continue to serve as a female officer”.
> 
> The CMHRK said: “It is now time for the South Korean military to set up guidelines and regulations about transgender people.”

In October 2021 a South Korean court ruled that the military acted unfairly by discharging her.

> A South Korean court ruled Thursday that the military acted unfairly by discharging a female soldier for having undergone gender-change surgery, a decision that led to her suicide months ago.
>
> Sergeant Byun Hee-soo, in her twenties, had voluntarily enlisted in 2017 and two years later underwent the intervention in Thailand. The Defense Ministry classified the removal of her male genitalia as a physical or mental disability and a committee decided in January 2020 to discharge her from the military.
>
> Her case was a pioneer in South Korea, a country still very conservative with issues related to sexual identity and less tolerant than other Asian countries regarding LGTBI rights. The soldier filed an administrative complaint in August 2020, but seven months later she was found dead at home.
>
> Now, the Daejeon district court (center) has ruled in her favor, saying that the army should have officially accepted her into their ranks as a woman after the surgery. The court, according to the Yonhap agency, had legally recognized her as a woman, making it impossible for the military authorities to conclude that she had ""a mental or physical disability.""
>
> The defense ministry told AFP that it ""respects the court's decision"" but has yet to decide whether to appeal.

She died in hospital.

> She was 23-years-old, born and raised in Cincinnati. On March 3, she became the latest Black trans woman murdered in the U.S.
> 
> Her name was Diamond Kyree Sanders. She also was known as Diamond Nicole.
> 
> Cincinnati police responded to a report of a person shot on Morrison Avenue around 3:42 a.m., according to a Wednesday afternoon news release. They discovered the wounded 23-year-old Kyree Sanders in a parking lot. Firefighters took Sanders to a hospital, where she died.
> 
> Police at first said it might have been a bias crime, then claimed it was ‘greed’ because her purse was stolen. I still don’t understand why the police are so quick to jump to conclusions about motive when they haven’t even caught the murderer. They don’t know the shooter was the one who stole her purse. Or that it was the motive rather than a hasty decision, perhaps to delay identifying the victim? I’m not clear on why it took so long for her death to be acknowledged by the media.
> 
> Diamond studied at The Ohio State University and had recently been working at Nordstrom.  She had thousands of friends on Facebook and her timeline was filled many cute, fashionable photos. The obituary written by her family speaks volumes to her dynamic personality and how much she was loved. Her 24th birthday would have been on April 10.

Diamond's obituary reads:

> “Diamond was a ball of energy as a child and even up to her time of death. She valued her family and enjoyed spending time with them. As a child, she would say “I love my WHOLE family!” At the last family Thanksgiving dinner, Diamond let her family know she was thankful that they accepted her for who she was as a transgender. In her younger years, Diamond spent many weekends with her Aunt Terron and Grandmother Dianne, baking cookies and making one of her favorite meals, “pigs in a blanket”. They also took Diamond and her siblings on trips to the Bahamas, Florida (Walt Disney World), Detroit and Gatlinburg to show her the world is much bigger than just Cincinnati.”
> 
> “As an adult, Diamond was a traveler, known to be in New York City one week and New Orleans the following week. Diamond was really into fashion. She always coordinated her attire from head to toe, including matching hair and nails. She was known to say, “I have to be cute, honey!” A few weeks before her death she was in her grandmother’s closet putting on her fur coat, clothes, and jewelry. Diamond’s unique style, charm, and personality will be greatly missed.”

Franchez Rivers, 33, Christopher Hisle, 28, and Kiara Davis, 29. were subsequently indicted for her murder:

> An attorney for one of three people charged in the March killing of a 23-year-old transgender woman in Clifton told a judge Thursday ""there is more to this case.""
>
> At an arraignment Thursday for Franchez Rivers, Hamilton County Municipal Judge William Mallory set bond for Rivers at $2 million. The 33-year-old Spring Grove Village resident was arrested Wednesday, court records say.
>
> Rivers was one of three people indicted Thursday by a Hamilton County grand jury in the March 3 fatal shooting of Diamond Kyree Sanders. The others charged are: Christopher Hisle, 28, and Kiara Davis, 29.
>
> Hisle has been in the Hamilton County Justice Center since April, after being arrested for illegally carrying a loaded gun in an incident unrelated to Sanders' death. Hisle had a previous felony conviction at the time. He pleaded guilty Sept. 8 to felony charges including carrying a concealed weapon. He also is charged with possessing ""a large amount of marijuana."" That case is still pending.
>
> Davis was arrested and jailed Thursday, records show.
>
> Rivers, Hisle and Davis are charged with murder, aggravated robbery and felonious assault.

> 
> Due to the state of decomposition of the corpse, forensic experts are still working to determine how Fabiola died and whether or not she was murdered.

In statements to CIUDAD TV, Canteros indicated that in the place where the young woman was found there were traces of blood ""but she has no bruises or [contusions].""

> ""So far the prosecutor has no information to assert that it is a homicide,"" said Canteros. ""Anyway, work continues on the autopsy,"" he clarified. In any case, the young woman's family believes that Fabiola was the victim of a homicide. ""They killed her,"" said a sister of the victim, according to the newspaper Norte.

At least one report states that her throat was cut.

> Nicaragua: Hate crime against a transgender young woman
> 
> In the last few hours, a new hate crime has been known about a 18-year-old Nicaraguan girl. On Tuesday, two alcoholic men killed Lala, a trans woman who had just begun with her transition. FemiTransLac report that in Nicaragua they do not respect the rights of the community and the facts are becoming more violent.
> 
> Lala died from head trauma due to the blows against her head. Her body, found on Wednesday, the attackers are already in custody.
> 
> According to the sexual diversity organizations in Nicaragua, an uptick of assaults on the LGTBI population has been manifested in the last minute. As far as the year goes, they already have 9 cis women killed, which is why they call on the state to create the conditions to stop these hate crimes.
> 
> What hurts us the most is that it's a young girl who was just starting her transition. She was 18 years old and we ask for Justice, that the full weight of the law be dropped. May the State of Nicaragua pledge to respect the rights of the LGTBI community and pass a gender identity bill. Since the lack of laws we suffer multiple violence.

In May 2021 Bernardo Arístides Pastrana Ochoa and Jorge Luis Mondragón Acosta were sentenced to life imprisonment for her murder.

> “I would agree to have [the birth name] in brackets but his [chosen name] first.”
> 
> Eventually, the parents agreed to split their son’s ashes and put both names on any memorial plaques. However, the 15-year-old’s deadname will appear on his death certificate because, before his death, he was unable to legally change it on his birth certificate.


> Loved ones described the 15-year-old as “a good and caring friend who always listened” and an “amazing artist who was great at drawing, painting and make-up”.

Once the firefighters were able to suffocate it, they discovered inside the body of its resident, Alberto Jesús Ochandio, 68 years old. The autopsy requested by Prosecutor No. 5 by Dr. Alejandro Pellegrinelli revealed the presence of more than twenty stab wounds.

> They also said that he had been threatening her with death. Relatives noticed that some home appliances and the victim's cell phone were missing.

On 31st March Marcelo de Almeida Moura was arrested in connection with her murder.

> The Civil Police last Wednesday (31) carried out an arrest warrant against Marcelo de Almeida Moura, suspected of murdering [trans woman] Alexandra Monteiro on March 7. The suspect was already detained in the Public Prison of Várzea Grande (Capão Grande). Marcelo already has convictions for attempted murder and for a rape committed against his own sister.
>
> Alexandra and Marcelo had been in a troubled relationship. Days before committing the murder, Marcelo, who was wearing an ankle tag by court order, broke the equipment - an action which caused a report to the police - claiming that he was forced to dispose of the device as a result of threats from five men.
>
> After killing Alexandra, the suspect took her cell phone and posted on the victim's social networks, saying ""#partiuRondonopolis"", implying that the victim had travelled elsewhere when Alexandra was lying dead in the bathroom of her home. The police verified that Marcelo already had a criminal record, with a history of homicide and also rape, committed against his own sister.

On 25th November 2021 her ex-partner Marcelo de Almeida Moura was sentenced to 22 years in prison for her murder. He had previously served time in prison for raping his half-sister, and had started threatening Alexandra after being released from prison for that offence.

> Marcelo de Almeida Moura was tried and convicted by the Jury of Cuiabá, on Thursday (25), for the murder of [trans woman] and former partner Alexandra Monteiro, whose registered name is [deadname] Correa de Oliveira. In an unprecedented conviction, the defendant was sentenced to 22 years in prison and denied the right to an appeal. In accordance with the complaint of the Public Ministry of Mato Grosso, the Sentence Council recognized the qualifiers of base motive, cruel employment and a crime committed against a “transfeminine person” involving domestic and family violence.

> A debt of R $ 5,000 led a drug user to kill a [trans woman] in Piraquara, in the metropolitan region of Curitiba (RMC). According to the Civil Police, the crime occurred at the behest of a drug dealer, since the victim intended to report her for trafficking to the police. Both were arrested and investigations into the case were concluded on Wednesday (10).
> 
> The investigation began after the family informed the police that the victim disappeared last Friday (5). “I had just arrested the woman in the act, for trafficking. So, I was on duty at the Central de Flagrantes in the metropolitan region and I knew that there was this police report (BO) talking about her disappearance”, said delegate Nasser Salmen to Banda B.
> 
> Three days later, on Monday (8), the body of the [trans woman] was found. The delegate said that the [trans woman] was killed with about 10 to 12 stab wounds. This, therefore, was the way that the principal of the crime found to “forgive” the user for the value of the narcotics he bought.
> 
> “The drug dealer, aware of the debt and possible complaint, asked the user to commit the murder. So, the boy took the [trans woman] into a bush in exchange for sexual services, but then stabbed her,” explained Salmen.
> 
> The perpetrator was arrested in the act and will be charged with murder and concealment of a corpse. The woman, who was already responsible for trafficking, will also answer in court as co-author of this crime.

> 
> Niharika Narasimhamurthy’s body was found alongside the Hindupur-Sira Highway Saturday morning with her throat slit and half burnt.
> 
> The police say that they are looking for two suspects, Rajasekhar and Hanumanthappa. According to the police, Rajasekhar was the victim’s longtime friend and lover. They say he used to visit often until his wife became suspicious. To ally his wife’s fears he killed Niharika first slicing her throat then dousing her with gasoline to set her afire.
> 
> The Hindu, which first reported on this, predictably told a different story. The Hindu wrote that Niharika was a working girl who died trying to extort her client for money. According to that narrative, Rajasekhar refused to pay her so Niharika threatened to out him. This ‘put him a spot’ so he killed her.
> 
> That would be a lot to assume since the killers hadn’t been caught. But it isn’t unexpected as it fits a pattern well established by Indian media. India’s transgender people will never stand a chance of achieving the level of equality guaranteed by their constitution and courts until the press and police treat them respectfully.

> Tegan first worked with us in 2016 on Femout and I met her a few months later when she accompanied a friend to a photoshoot even for nominees prior to the 2017 TEA Awards – and I encouraged her to get her photos taken also, which she was excited about.  I only met her a few times, but if I had to sum her up in one word, it would be that she was very ‘sweet’.Tegan’s work continued with us on other sites  – appearing in scenes at the end of 2020.  
> 
> She worked with us the Friday before her death, with producer Radius Dark, who described her as ‘one of the sweetest, nicest people I’ve met in the industry‘.
> 
> It always comes as a shock when someone so young, with so many friends and who seemed to be moving forward with her life, ends it so suddenly and tragically.  I know she was well liked among the community, and many models counted her as a friend – as seen by their many tributes and celebrations of her left on social media. Tegan was a disabled veteran of the Army, having served in Afghanistan and had been living in Las Vegas in recent years, where she had many friends and was part of the trans adult community, co-creating content as well as working on her own content.
> 
> Dan Hogue, Director of Operations at Transerotica was called to Tegan’s house shortly after her death and has been instrumental along with other friends, in assisting and giving support to Tegan’s partner, Jean.  “We are all hurting and are confused with this loss of a friend. There is an emptiness among many.  We may never know the reason why. There is help for those that need it.   Let the overall message be to seek assistance! Never be afraid to ask for help, reach out to a fellow performer or colleague. There is also anonymous resources available in Pineapple Support and other trusted folks in the industry that would always drop what they are doing and make time for you.”
> 
> All of us at Grooby, pass on our love, our respect and condolences to her partner, her family and  her friends, and to the many performers who worked with Tegan.  I’ll continue to remember her as that sweet, lovely girl I met sitting on the sofa, at the TEA photoshoot.

An attorney has called for an investigation.

The officers involved have been placed on paid administrative leave.

> An attorney is calling for the California Attorney General to investigate the March 28 officer-involved shooting of a Lompoc transgender male because of officials' alleged conflicts of interest in a letter sent to the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office, the District Attorney's office and the Lompoc Police Department.
> 
> Krys Brandon Ruiz, 26, died from a fatal gunshot wound following an altercation with Lompoc Police officers minutes after they received a report of a person walking northbound on H Street with a handgun shortly after 8 p.m., according to Capt. Kevin Martin.
> 
> The case was turned over to the office of Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown, who was the Lompoc police chief from 1995 to 2006 before becoming Sheriff. 
> 
> Bill Schmidt, a Fresno-based attorney representing Ruiz's family, cited as a foundation for the request Government Code 12525.3, which deals with police shootings of unarmed people, and AB 1506, a law approved by the governor on Sept. 30, 2020, that requires a state prosecutor to investigate when police use deadly force. 
> 
> ""Bill Brown oversaw the recruitment and training of that city's police officers,"" Schmidt wrote in the April 7 letter addressed to the sheriff's office and the attorney general's office. ""Sheriff Brown is not only the county's top law enforcement officer, he is also the coroner, charged with determining the manner and cause of death in this and similar cases."" 
> 
> Additionally, Schmidt said the Attorney General should investigate because District Attorney Joyce Dudley helped develop statewide deadly force training and has never prosecuted an officer involved in a deadly shooting. 
> 
> Dudley confirmed receipt of Schmidt's letter on Friday, but did not offer comment and referred to the sheriff's office, which responded to an emailed inquiry, but did not provide comment. 
> 
> Neither the Lompoc Police Department nor the attorney general's office responded to requests for comment on Friday. 
> 
> An hour before the shooting, Ruiz was dropped off at his apartment by his mother after dinner, blocks away from the shooting location, according to Schmidt, adding Ruiz wasn't intoxicated or agitated. 
> 
> ""We don’t know what happened, whether they were trying to take him into custody for some reason, but we believe that it was virtually impossible that he had a gun, as far as we know,"" Schmidt said. ""The reality is that the police control all of the evidence and all of the information."" 
> 
> Schmidt believes the shooting involved poor training standards, although he added that has yet to be seen. He filed a records request Thursday with Lompoc Police to release information about the incident, including all video recordings. 


A memorial service for Krys was held on Friday 16th April. According to his obituary:

> Krys faced many challenges in his short life. At the age of seven, he was diagnosed with Type-1 Diabetes and dealt with the daily struggles of the disease with courage and strength. Family and friends rallied around him and supported his health and wellness journey.
> 
> Krys was passionate about music and he followed many artists over the years in different genres, such as: Hip Hop, R & B, Oldies, Country, Mexican and Reggae. Krys loved to sing karaoke and would sing alone or in the company of others, many times using the popular apps Smule and Tiktok. More recently, he began to write music lyrics both serious and funny in nature. He also wrote poetry. Krys loved Demi Lovato; he knew all of her songs. He found a connection to her through her life struggles and lyrics. Krys also loved Vicente Fernandez, Los Tigres del Norte, Los Freddy's, Jenni Rivera, and Selena. Music was a special talent Krys had and he will be remembered through the many musical recordings he left behind.
> 
> Krys was blessed in life with good, solid friendships over the years. He usually bonded with those that shared his love for either music or dogs. Some of Krys' special friends are, Kira Kazianka, Bri Gusman, and Baylee Roche. They all bonded and remained close friends over the years, despite distance and time.
> 
> Krys's smile lit up any room; it was very captivating. He was known for his ever-changing hair color. Along with his love of painting his face in different ways (from clown faces to scary faces and a short emo phase) he loved wearing baseball caps, comfy t-shirts, sunglasses and creative masks.
