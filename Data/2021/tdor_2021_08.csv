> Bike-borne youths gunned down Sumana Dhar, a transgender person, when she was about to step into her house in Sabitri Pally in Nimta, about 16km north from the heart of Calcutta, on Sunday evening.
>
> Sumana was a prominent voice within the community, who would protest against alleged wrongdoings by some of the members in Birati, Nimta and adjoining areas. Some of those who knew the 32-year-old said Sumana used to attend meetings and conferences on transgender rights and tried to persuade several of the community members not to engage in infighting.
>
> In Nimta, Sumana organised small meetings to try and influence some of the community members to refrain from certain activities that create a wrong impression about transgender people in public minds, police said.
>
> “Sumana came across as a very upright individual who wanted to reform some members of the community across parts of North 24-Parganas,” said Ranjita Sinha, a transgender activist and former member of the West Bengal Transgender Welfare Board. “This murder sends out very disturbing signals for our community.”
>
> The police said four youths came riding motorcycles around 7pm and fired four bullets from close range, leaving Sumana in a pool of blood on the road leading to her house, which is located in an area under North Dum Dum Municipality.

Two people were subsequently arrested.

Her death is being treated as a homicide.

> The Biobío Regional Prosecutor's Office ordered the PDI Homicide Brigade to investigate the death of a trans woman in Concepción after being injected with chemical products for cosmetic purposes.
> 
> According to initial information, the death of the trans woman occurred inside her home. A man had traveled from the Metropolitan Region to the regional capital of Biobío to apply the silicone injection.
> 
> The prosecutor in charge, Jorge Lorca, pointed out that “ Carabineros reported that a 36-year-old person inside a home who had apparently undergone cosmetic [filler] injections but had felt ill in the afternoon. She did not go to any health care center and when SAMU arrived, this person died. We are investigating the substance involved.”
> 
> The Amanda Jofré Trans People's Union pointed out that the victim was a trans woman from Concepción who did not manage to legally process her gender change and had to resort to this type of illegal surgeries, since they are “Very expensive and difficult to access” by regular means.

> “For trans women, part of having a healthy transition is also being able to perform aesthetic interventions in a safe and comprehensive way for our community.

> “Brazil is the country that kills the most LGBT community and people who are not killed violently end up committing suicide. We need to remember that Mogi das Cruzes has a large community that we need to provide public policies so that they can be included and gain dignity”, said Paz.
>
> “This Plenary and Brazilian society are maturing to understand that people have the right to have their gender identity and to be happy as they think they should be. Today, Brazil, unfortunately, is one of the countries that most murder gays, lesbians and transsexuals”, lamented Iduigues.

> A 17-year-old transgender girl was murdered in Tamil Nadu’s Salem district, allegedly by her brother who didn’t approve of his sibling’s gender id. The teenager’s identify was Dakshayani, based on trans neighborhood members in Salem, and he or she was murdered at Thuttampatti village of Salem district on August 30. The Tharamangalam police arrested 25-year-old Selvaraj, who reportedly stated that he killed his sibling as a result of he seen her trans id as a ‘shame’ to his household and kin.
>
> Selvaraj and Dakshayani have been reportedly dwelling with their kin after their mother and father died. Rakshika Raj, a social activist and one of many first out trans girls to work as a nurse on the Chengalpattu GH, says, “Ever since Dakshayani started expressing her gender, she has faced abuse from her family. Over time, she befriended a few trans women in Salem and ran away to Chengalpattu, because living with the abusive birth family became difficult for the minor.”
>
> However, as a result of Dakshayani was a minor, this posed numerous challenges for herself and the neighborhood. Legally, a minor needs to be in the care of their birth household, or in a rehabilitation facility — however provided that ordered by a courtroom. While trans individuals by way of the ages have discovered their chosen families inside trans communities, the Rights of Transgender Persons Act, 2019, doesn’t recognise the neighborhood as “family” — and insists on trans kids, who typically face abuse from their birth families, to stick with them. While transgender communities throughout the nation opposed the Bill when it was launched in Parliament, it was nonetheless handed by the federal government and is in pressure at the moment.
