Two young children who were present at the time were fortunately unharmed.

Marcus Chavis, 35, was arrested at the scene and confessed to killing the two women.

> On Sunday Transgender woman Jahaira DeAlto, 42, was murdered at her home in Dorchester, Massachusetts.
> 
> Jahaira DeAlto was hosting Marcus Chavis and his family when Chavis killed her and his wife, Fatima Yasin, while also stabbing a dog, according to the Suffolk County District Attorney’s Office. They haven’t determined a motive for the attack.
> 
> The man accused of killing 28-year-old Fatima Yasin and 42-year-old transgender woman Jahaira DeAlto was ordered held without bail Monday, Suffolk County District Attorney Rachael Rollins said in a press release.
>
> The officers located Ms. Yasin and Ms. DeAlto in separate bedrooms, each suffering from serious stab wounds to the neck. Tragically, both victims succumbed to their injuries. A dog with a stab wound was also located in the same bedroom as Ms. DeAlto and taken to MSPCA Angell Animal Medical Center for treatment.
> 
> The children who were present were physically uninjured and are currently safe and being cared for.


Jahira was an activist who advocated for equality and for victims of abuse and an active member of the ballroom community.

> The ballroom community is mourning the death of a legend this week after news broke that activist Jahaira DeAlto died after being stabbed on Sunday.
> 
> ""The House of Balenciaga regretfully acknowledges the death/murder of our own Jahaira M. DeAlto, a community advocate and friend to many,"" Harold Balenciaga wrote to Facebook Sunday night. ""Let us not forget her ongoing work against domestic abuse and continue to uplift her name and ensure her memory lives on in this ironic twist of fate."" The killing makes DeAlto the 21st reported trans killing this year, putting 2021 on track to be the deadliest on record for trans Americans. She is the seventh trans woman of color to be killed in a month.
> 
> Within ballroom, DeAlto was a member of the House of Balenciaga. She made her name in Boston, and became a legend for the category of realness. In her subcategory, fem queen realness, trans women competed to pass for cisgender women. DeAlto's specialty was everyday realness. She started walking in 1996, first walking runway and then in 1999 she began walking realness. After her first winning ball walking realness, she stuck with the category. She also built her own devoted personal family, helping to nurture other members of the community. She wrote about that experience last year on Mother's Day.
> 
> ""I am the mother who raised the children whose rainbow sparkled too brightly and blinded their birth moms,"" she wrote to Twitter in a thread. ""I cherished what they discarded. I took on earthly assignments for moms who'd earned their Heavenly reward. For their babies who still needed raising. I did that. And I'm still doing that. And I'll keep doing that. Because I will never know what seeing my DNA reflected in another's eyes could look like, but I know what gratitude in the eyes of a young person who finally feels seen looks like. And for me, that's enough.""
> 
> But she was also a vocal activist outside the scene, having begun that work in 1995. For years DeAlto operated a YouTube channel vlogging about her life, speaking out on social justice issues, and also talking about inner-community conversations regarding trans women.
> 
> ""The mission is all about helping you place yourself on a higher priority in your own life, and essentially living the best life that you possibly can, the most authentic life, the life that is true to you,"" she said in an introductory video to the channel. Her activism work included speaking at various events like Trans Day of Remembrance rallies and more — she was the emcee and featured speaker at the Berkshires' first Transgender Day of Remembrance event n 201.
> 
> “It’s important to be visible,” she told Freedom Massachusetts while she was a student at Berkshire Community College of her work. She's since spoken at the Ryan White Conference on HIV/AIDS, Harvard University, and was a guest lecturer at Columbia University's School of Social work. “It is still vitally important we leverage our privilege to provide educational opportunities for people to learn more. The more we humanize ourselves for those who don’t think they’ve encountered a transgender person, the more we’re able to remove the stigma and fear surrounding the perception of what trans people are. Education is our greatest weapon against ignorance. After having the experience of meeting Jahaira DeAlto, you can no longer say you’ve never met a trans person.” DeAlto graduated from Berkshire Community College in August 2019 with an Associate's Degree in Human Services.

She was an activist who - under the name Mistress Velvet - was known as a Dominatrix who made her clients read Black Feminist Theory.

> CHICAGO — Music, tears and laughter filled the halls of First Lutheran Church of the Trinity in Bridgeport on Saturday, where loved ones of well-known dominatrix Mistress Velvet shared stories celebrating the trailblazing activist’s life.
> 
> Visitors created artwork and lit candles in Velvet’s memory, and the church was decorated with altars covered in flowers, photos and knickknacks from the iconic dominatrix’s apartment.
> 
> Friends sang and danced to a playlist of Velvet’s favorite music — a mix heavy with Beyoncé, Rihanna, SZA and Coldplay — as Velvet’s dog, Kuma, patrolled the room, giving affection to loved ones when they teared up and needed comforting. Visitors were encouraged to mingle during the four-hour memorial, which at times felt more like a ceremony in celebration of Mistress Velvet, known personally as Dani Achiaa B.
> 
> “This is a community that we all built — a community that Dani built — and that’s why we’re here and we should get to know one another,” said organizer Erica Kadel, one of B.’s close friends.

**[Meet The Dominatrix Who Requires The Men Who Hire Her To Read Black Feminist Theory](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mistress-velvet_n_5a822b50e4b00ecc923d4eba)**


A subsequent report confirmed that Dani died by suicide:

> Mistress Velvet died by suicide May 8 after months of struggling with their mental health, friends said.
> 
> “The last few months have been extremely dark [for Dani], and it’s not something we want to gloss over,” Kadel said. “It’s not something we’re ashamed of and it’s not something that Dani was ashamed of, either. It takes a lot of work to be vulnerable publicly, and we don’t know who that touched or inspired to ask for help.”
> 
> Velvet was famous for making their white, male clients read about Black feminist theory. And they advocated for multiple causes as an executive director for the Sex Workers Outreach Project USA and as director of education and training for Resilience, an Illinois-based nonprofit that advocates for survivors of sexual violence.

> Velvet got started in sex work about 10 years ago, but struggled at first to find their confidence as a dominatrix, Koch said. The two married in 2015 — the same year they moved from North Carolina to Chicago.
> 
> “The first session they had, they were very nervous and couldn’t hit hard enough, so the client said to them, ‘You should really stick to regular sex work because you’ll never be a domme,'” Koch said. “And they took that as a challenge and really built up a vibrant practice as a domme.”
> 
> By 2017, Velvet had started incorporating their studies, which included a master’s degree in women and gender studies from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, into their dominatrix work by making clients read Black feminist texts during sessions.
> 
> “I describe it as a form of reparations — not in a systemic way like we’re getting land back, but definitely on an individual level, it provides me with an emotional sense of reparations,” Velvet explained in a 2018 Q&A with the Huffington Post. “That’s because of the nature of the dynamic ― that [my clients] usually are white men, that they’re straight, and they’re usually pretty well-off to be able to sustain a relationship with a domme.”

Like far too many trans murder victims, local police repeatedly deadnamed and misgendered her.

> Transgender woman Serenity Hollis, 24, was shot and killed execution-style on May 8th at 4:00 am., while walking along West Highland Ave. in Albany Georgia. Albany police have repeatedly deadnamed and misgendered Serenity Hollis in media reports. However, the DA recently said ‘every indication’ pointed to her murder being a hate crime.
> 
> The APD has released a grainy video of the murder on Facebook but settings prohibit sharing it. It shows an individual approaching Serenity Hollis from behind and apparently shooting her in the back of her head. The perp then fled on foot. Planet trans zoomed into the three seconds before her murder. It appears that she was wearing a skirt and sensible heels.
> 
> “I don’t think it’s random. I believe honestly because of the way [she] carried [herself] that a lot of people took offense to it,” her sister Sara Osberry said. “So honestly I believe it was either a hate crime or an act of revenge for some reason.”

He subsequently shot himself.

> In a case that occurred this afternoon in the town of Los Hornos in La Plata, a 23-year-old Buenos Aires Police officer murdered his partner, a young woman of the same age, in a femicide, along with a 22 [other sources say 20]-year-old trans woman and then shot himself in the head, leaving himself in critical condition. He died a few hours later.
> 
> The violent sequence began around 2:30 p.m. in 164 between 62 and 63 when a call to 911 indicated that detonations of firearms had been heard. Troops from the La Plata Patrol Command and Third Police Station went to the scene and immediately noticed the presence of the body of a young woman lying on the street and that of a trans woman in a corridor. An ambulance arrived at the scene and the doctors found that both people no longer showed vital signs.
>
> Neighbors gave clues about the attacker, who had fled the scene in a white Volkswagen Gol car. In an operation, the police located the suspect and there was a chase up to 166 between 59 and 60. In that direction the alleged aggressor got out of the car, showed a firearm to the police and went into a residence. Minutes later a detonation was heard and upon entering the uniformed men they found the young man with a shot to the head, after which he was rushed to the San Martín Hospital.
> 
> Initial investigations confirmed that the shooting was a femicide and that the young trans woman was shot when she went to see what happened. The policeman was identified as Juan Ignacio Soto, who served in the UTOI, Florencia Sandoval (23) and Cielo de Lucca (22).


Soto was reportedly violent and [Cielo had defended Florencia from him before](https://www.eldia.com/nota/2021-5-12-2-55-42--cielo-la-defendio-mas-de-una-vez-de-ese-violento--policiales).

> The day of her violent death was not the first time that Cielo defended her neighbor. The two had made very good friends during the four months in which they shared land, by dividing, in 164 between 62 and 63.
> 
> The young trans woman moved to one of the three apartments that are rented on the property with her sister, but she left shortly after and the costs of the rent were left for a single person. José María (58), owner of the place, said that the deceased's idea was to leave. That's where she was when she was killed.
> 
> Agostina asserted that “that violent son of a bitch (by Juan Ignacio Soto) attacked her more than once and Cielo defended her. She told me that he would not leave them alone and from then on the chabón took hold of him and was suspicious”. To such an extent that the last time the sex workers saw each other ""was on the street, a month ago, and it was there that she told me what was happening and showed that she was all hurt,"" he remarked.
> 
> “She died doing what she loved, defending and helping those in need. I can assure you that she was a person without evil, honest and very sociable.”

During the kidnapping Arik Reed, 22, was also shot and died from his injuries.

> SILVERTON, OR (KPTV) - A kidnapping victim has died at a hospital one week after an officer-involved shooting on Highway 214, according to Oregon State Police.
> 
> OSP said the teenager was pronounced dead at Doernbecher Children's Hospital on Wednesday. OSP did not identify the teen, but family spoke with FOX 12 last week and identified their transgender son, 17-year-old Oliver Taylor, as the victim.
> 
> According to court documents, Taylor was injured during an officer-involved shooting on May 12. OSP says the incident began at about 4:45 p.m., when the Gervais Police Department was called out to a disturbance in the 1000 block of Depot Court. Officers arrived to the scene and found Arik Reed, 22, of Gervais with a gunshot wound.
> 
> Court documents state Kenneth Williams Peden III, 20, shot Reed and then kidnapped Taylor. Officers learned that Peden left the area in a Ford F-150. A Marion County deputy located the truck and attempted to stop it but Peden fled and a pursuit ensued. During the pursuit, OSP said Peden fired multiple rounds toward law enforcement as they traveled through Silverton.
> 
> The Ford came to a stop on Highway 214 near Forest Ridge Road Northeast where Peden exchanged gunfire with officers, according to OSP. Peden was detained at the scene. Taylor was found inside the truck, shot and badly hurt. Investigators didn’t say at what point the teen was shot, but court documents say Peden tried to kill Taylor with a handgun.
>

Their beaten body was found three days after they had gone missing.

Three suspects were subsequently arrested.

> Three days after going missing, Ebeng Mayor, a non-binary trans person, was found dead, bloodied, and bruised, with a wooden stick impaled in their genitals. It was believed that they were raped before being killed. Another victim, transgender woman Jhie Bangkiao, was found naked with a bloodied head in a cemetery.
> 
> Both members of the transgender community were found brutally murdered, a few days after the celebration of International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia, Interphobia, and Transphobia
> 
> These brutal murders are not just a loss of life– these are also crimes fueled by hate. This goes to show that the passage of the SOGIE Equality Bill is urgent. What transpired is a clear manifestation that the LGBT+ community is not safe in the country. This is not the first case of aggression and harassment towards the LGBT+ community. It is high time for the state to recognize that these are not isolated cases, rather attacks that are based on the SOGIE of the victims. We have been a target of harassment in society for a long time, and this will go on as long as perpetrators are not held accountable, and as long as the culture of violence and transphobia exists in the Philippines.
> 
> Bahaghari-UP Baguio Chapter expresses our deepest condolences to the families of the victims. We are one with the clamor for justice. Furthermore, we call on the authorities to conduct a full investigation regarding the cases of Ebeng and Junjie, and to hold those involved accountable. We also call on the government to pass the SOGIE Equality Bill immediately. The passage of the bill is set to make the country a safer space for the LGBT+ community as it ensures that crimes against the LGBT+ are held accountable.

A suspect has been charged and is due to be tried in June 2022.

> The family of a U.S. Air Force veteran who was murdered in May has identified her as transgender, making her the at least 49th transgender person to be killed violently in the United States this year, according to the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) 
> 
> 65-year-old Cris Blehar was found stabbed and shot to death in her Kentucky home. An 18-year-old suspect, Tyler J. Petty, who police say may have worked for Blehar, has reportedly confessed to the murder and will go to trial in June 2022.
> 
> Blehar’s obituary describes her as an animal lover who formerly worked for Continental Airlines and then as an Uber Driver. She left behind a son, [name redacted].
> 
> Blehar’s cousin, Mark Stephens, contacted HRC to identify her as trans. Stephens wanted Blehar to be “remembered, honored, and counted.”


Cris was a former law enforcement officer in the U.S. Air Force and retired from United/Continental Airlines. She also worked as an Uber driver and loved animals and bowling.

> “If there is one thing to know about Cris, it was that she fought fiercely to define her life as SHE wanted. Whether it was her military service, her 20+ year career in the airline industry, or her post retirement decision to buy a farm & start a family of her own. She lived life to the fullest and wanted everyone around her to live their best life as well. Growing up ‘different’ in Kentucky is certainly no easy task, something we shared in addition to being cousins, and she tackled it with the passion and zeal that only she could have. Her friends will always remember her infectious personality & her unmistakable laugh. She loved others passionately and fiercely, none more than her own son, [name redacted].”
> 
> Blehar’s son [name redacted] also remembered her, writing:
> 
> “Cris was an amazing mother and a wonderful person. She had so much love and brought a smile to many. She had a hilarious sense of humor that will live on through those that knew her. She will be sorely missed!”
> 
> Cris was full of life and it is appalling that she was so violently taken from this Earth. It is comforting to know that she was well loved by friends and family, but her death highlights the need to combat gun violence and all of the factors that contribute to these killings.”
 
As Cris' murder only came to light after the Transgender Day of Remembrance 2021 her name was not included in the official TDoR 2021 list released by Transgender Europe (TGEU) in November 2021.

> Williams was previously Chair of The 343, a Belfast-based charity and Feminist-led Queer Arts Space. She also co-founded We Exist, an organisation created to provide emergency support for transgender and gender non-conforming individuals in the UK, as well as 343 radio, the first ever queer radio station in Ireland.

> Following her death, We Exist posted a powerful tribute on their social media channels: “We have lost a mentor, leader, beloved friend, sister and inspiration. Her passion, talent, ferocity, commitment to justice, kindness and generosity were unbounded.
> 
> “Wherever she went, Sophie brought light to everyone around her. We, Sophie’s chosen family in London, extend our love to all those who loved and cared for her in Belfast and beyond. Sophie gave her all fighting for a world in which trans people can thrive. We will continue her legacy in all the work that we do.
> 
> “For the community in London, there will be a vigil in the coming days but for now we need time. We love you Sophie. Rest in power beautiful angel.”

Sophie had been on a waiting list for a first appointment at an NHS Gender Identity Clinic for *five and a half years*.

> A poster with further details surrounding Williams’ death has gone viral online. According to the statement in the poster, she was waiting on an NHS waiting list for five and a half years for a “first assessment” at the Gender Identity Clinic.
> 
> “On moving to London from Belfast last summer she was told by the staff at the G.I.C. that she was to wait a further FOUR YEARS for her FIRST assessment. On May 20th 2021 our darling Sophie took her own life,” it reads.
> 
> “Losing Sophie is a personal tragedy, but it’s also a public disgrace. How is any working trans* person supposed to survive nearly A DECADE amid a maelstrom of gender dysphoria and the repeated mental health crises that it brings on?
> 
> “It’s a howling injustice. The staff of the G.I.C. failed our best friend and creative soulmate. They failed Sophie, and now we will never see her again.”

> 
> Officers were responding to a call of a person with a gun in the area of 200 East Kenilworth Avenue in Villa Park, Illinois – a village within the Chicago metropolitan area.
> 
> After arriving on the scene, officers said they encountered a person walking “directly toward them while armed” with what they believed was a handgun. Police said Bailey was told to “drop the gun several times”. An officer then “shot the person four times when they refused”.
> 
> Officials said they later recovered a “black pellet gun made to look like a Sig Sauer 1911 pistol”.
> 
> Police reportedly began life-saving measures at the scene, and Bailey was transported to Good Samaritan Hospital where he later died from his injuries.

She had been an activist for over 30 years and was directly involved in the creation of laws to protect LGBT+ people, sex workers and women.

> Gloria Álvez passed away on Sunday, May 30 at the age of 78. With more than 30 years of activism for the rights of transgender people and the LGBTI community, she left an indelible legacy for new generations: the creation of the Sex Work Law (17.515), the Right to Gender Identity Law Violence:Lorrane de Souza (Petrolina - 19 Aug 2021)(18,620) and, more recently, the Comprehensive Law for Trans Persons (19,684). As a result of her participation in the design of these laws, for her tireless activism for the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases and her battle against the sexual exploitation of girls, boys and adolescents she was recognized nationally and internationally.
> 
> In 1990 Gloria founded the first trans collective in the country, whose name was the Transvestite Coordination Board, currently called the Uruguayan Trans Association (ATRU). She was its president and then its secretary. In recent years, she has also worked as the Uruguayan coordinator of the Latin American and Caribbean Network of Trans People (Redlactrans).
> 
> Gloria was a survivor. She went through the Children's Council in Salto, where she suffered abuse and mistreatment, was also confined in the Salto hospital and, during the dictatorship and post-dictatorship, resisted the confinement and torture imparted by police and military to trans people, called by they ""passive pedophiles."" In 1954, she served as a ""guinea pig"" for the doctors who applied the so-called ""sexual conversion therapy"", which consisted of giving electric shocks, recalled the Frente Amplio deputy Ana Olivera, who paid tribute to her in Parliament on Wednesday.
