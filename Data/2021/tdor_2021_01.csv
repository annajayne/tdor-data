The perpetrator (who had previously tried to kill his own mother) confessed to her murder.

> The death of a 13-year-old teenager, who was known as Keron Ravach, shocked the city of Camocim, 457 km from Fortaleza. The student was beaten to death, hit with blows and punches. Friends report that Keron was shy, but had the dream of being known and becoming a digital influencer. She was going through a gender transition process.
> 
> Keron was killed at dawn on Monday, April 4. The main suspect, a 17-year-old teenager, was apprehended. According to the head of the Camocim Police Station, Chief Herbert Ponte, the boy confessed to the crime and says he met the victim to do a sexual program. However, there was a disagreement over the payment of the amounts and he killed the girl. He attacked by stabbing, beating, punching and kicking her.

She died at the scene and Brandon Gowdy, 31, died in hospital.

> A Black transgender woman from Chicago was shot to death earlier this month, marking the second recent murder of a trans woman in the city.
> 
> Davarea Alexander, 28, who was also known as Tyianna, was one of two individuals who were shot and killed near a railroad line at 817 West 75th Street, police told Gay City News. The other victim, who was 31 years old, was shot in the lower left side and upper left bicep.
> 
> So far, there’s not enough information available to indicate whether the killing of Alexander was motivated by anti-trans bias. The killing came just weeks after a different trans woman, [Courtney “Eshay” Key](https://tdor.translivesmatter.info/reports/2020/12/25/courtney-eshay-key_chicago-illinois-usa_c5fc20e3), was fatally shot to death in Chicago on Christmas.
> 
> “It’s really difficult to prove unless you have someone in custody,” Sally Brown, a public information officer for the Chicago Police Department, said in an interview with Gay City News. “It’s just so hard to classify something as a hate crime without a lot of evidence pointing to that.”
> 
> Chicago police — who originally misgendered Alexander — did not directly respond to a question about whether the 31-year-old victim was transgender. The Chicago Police Department currently does not have a process for collecting a victim’s gender identity. Instead, they conflate gender with a person’s sex assigned at birth. Brown said officers were not trying to “insult” the victim but were documenting the sex listed on her government-issued ID.
> 
> “I know people were upset about that at first, but that’s the reasoning behind it. We’re very sensitive to those things,” Brown said. “It’s just they have to put something down on the report like that.”
> 
> Meanwhile, police have yet to make headway in solving Key’s death. Nobody has been taken into custody and sources told the Chicago Tribune the motive is unclear, but Key’s family believes she was killed because she was a trans woman. The family is requesting that the department investigate the case as a hate crime.

She died in hospital.

The gunman who killed her was subsequently identified and arrested.

> A 24-year-old trans woman was killed early this Sunday during a gunshot attack in Granadero Baigorria. In the same incident a 20-year-old man was hospitalized after being injured. He is out of danger.
> 
> According to information provided by the Public Prosecutor's Office (MPA), the attack occurred in the Montevideo area at 1300 when at least three unidentified people traveling by car fired multiple shots against a group of people who were on a public road.
> 
> The victim was taken to Eva Perón Hospital in serious condition and shortly afterwards her death was reported as a result of gunshot wounds to the chest, abdomen and upper limbs.

Like many trans women in Latin America, Natalia had to do sex work to survive. She wanted to study instead, but her circumstances precluded that.

> Natalia Maldonado was 24 when a flurry of gunfire ended her life. She wanted to start studying and quit sex work - a way of making living to which transgender women are still condemned despite the efforts of the areas of the State and the LGTBIQ + collective to build decent lives. Her friends and relatives remember her as a faithful, loving, companion and a defender of the trans community.
> 
> Natalia lived alone in a house located in the Nuestra Señora de La Paz neighborhood, on a street known as Camino Muerto, in the southwest of Granadero Baigorria. THher economic situation was not the best at the time. And although she was not an activist in any group, she received food bags from the community to help her to weather the economic crisis, as she was dedicated to sex work like so many other girls.
> 
> Those who knew Natalia Maldonado ""since she was 11 years old"" tell us that she was a good friend who she had no problems with anyone. ""She had a strong character but that did not stop her from being a good, kind and loving person,"" Natalia Maldonado's friends, who used to get together during the afternoons, told La Capital.

Natalia's birth family was less accommodating than her friends and neighbours. At her funeral, her mother deadnamed and misgendered her.

On Thursday 14th January a 23 year old was charged with her murder.

> Micael Z., 23, was charged and detained for 60 days preventive detention this Thursday by prosecutors Adrián Spelta and Aquiles Balbis. He is so far the only person arrested for the murder of Natalia Maldonado, the 24-year-old trans woman who was shot on Sunday night in a corner of Granadero Baigorria, and is formally accused of the crimes of intentional homicide aggravated by the use of a firearm, in a degree of consummate as a functional co-author. An attempted crime was also attributed to him, as a 20-year-old was injured in the shooting.

> ATLANTA — Atlanta Police are investigating two deaths after the victims, described only as a male and a female, were found dead along a major Atlanta route on Sunday evening.
>
> Police said they responded to the area of Joseph E. Boone Boulevard and Troy Street around 8:30 p.m. after a caller said he had found his friend shot inside an apartment. Upon entry, police said they found a male and female dead from apparent gunshot wounds. Police added that one of the victims' injuries appeared to be self-inflicted but didn't say which. Authorities did not provide an age for the victims or suggest whether they were adults or juveniles.


> Bianca “Muffin” Bankz a trans woman of color was found murdered in her apartment Sunday, January 17, 2021. Details surrounding her death are murky, but friends say but that her life was taken by a man in her home, who ultimately took his own life.
> 
> Bianca “Muffin” Bankz is the second transgender woman to be murdered in Atlanta in the past 18 days. [Bonaire (Bonni) Black](https://tdor.translivesmatter.info/reports/2020/12/31/bonaire-bonnie-black_atlanta-georgia-usa_b00be59f), 19, was found dead on December 31, 2020, under a blanket in a parking garage in midtown Atlanta.
> 
> Jesse Pratt López founder of the Trans Housing Coalition (THC) wrote on Facebook “during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have worked nonstop to get as many trans and nonbinary people off the streets and into relative safety as quickly as possible. These efforts have often extended to people who were not enrolled in our program, but connected to our clients.”
> 
> “We met Muffin when we were unable to take on any new clients. Because she was good friends with our client, Africa, she became Africa’s roommate and we were able to at least provide housing for her over the past few months.”
> 
> Muffin and Africa knew each other for eight years. They were homeless together, lived together in emergency housing, and just last month moved into an apartment together with our help. According to Africa, Muffin was a good friend, a girl who “if you forgot the butter [at the store] she already had it.”
> 
> Muffin didn’t have a relationship with her blood family. She was a child of the foster care system in Florida and moved to Atlanta in her early 20s where she found her chosen family. She and Africa were so close, that Africa’s mother became like a mother to her too.
> 
> Muffin was blossoming into herself. She had recently begun her medical transition in November. Her hope, according to Africa, was to compete on RuPaul’s Drag Race. They were supposed to compete together.

A vigil was held at her home on 1177 Joseph E. Boone Blvd NW on Friday, 29th January.

> The risk of being transgender in Mexico, stigmas and discrimination are factors that have led the country to second place worldwide in hate crimes against transgender, only after Brazil.

After she died her birth family tried to quietly erase her identity, but news of her death went viral in Italy.

> A case of transphobia in the city of Andria where Gianna died, a transgender person who is remembered by her family on funeral posters with a man's name, which we will not repeat. The first to denounce the gesture was Vladimir Luxuria through a [tweet](https://twitter.com/vladiluxuria/status/1351618695840329731), telling what happened with the commitment and disdain for the new case of transphobia that took place in Puglia.
>
> Luxuria wrote: ""A transgender person, Gianna, indigent and discarded by society, dies in Andria. The family decides to put up funeral posters with his male name (which I prefer not to repeat). An offense to the name and identity with which everyone knew her"".
> 
> Riccardo Pirrone, SMM of Taffo Funeral Services replied to Vladimir. Taffo is a funeral agency known for its ability to comment on reality with irony, and he offered to redo the posters and spread them virally on the net, in response to the transphobic actions [of Gianna's birth family].


Gianna was desperately poor and had never been accepted by her family. Vladamir had met her some time before during a discussion about civil rights and transphobia in the city.

> Among the voices that of Gianna rose, remembered by Luxuria to the Messenger with sincere condolences: “As she spoke it was clear to everyone that she no longer wanted to be insulted. She asked for a hearing, a council house. I was struck by the dignity of her person, that which does not depend on social class or gender identity - it is something much deeper, like those eyes of her mixed with rimmel and tears.
>
> After the debate I wanted to get to know her better, I realized she was a person who had been through all sorts of things. Feeling rejected by everyone, she had found refuge in alcohol and today, unfortunately, I received the news of her death and also of these absurd funeral posters. I wanted to testify to my closeness to a person ""discriminated against by the square"". Because of her [gender identity] but also because one cannot live in a house without heating or electricity, concluded Vladimir.


Funeral home staff themselves are fed up with birth families treating deceased trans people in this way:

> Among the thousands of comments on Taffo's post  who shared the correct version of the manifesto on his page, the comment of a fellow citizen stands out who confirms: ""I'm from Andria, I knew and saw her every day. Working in a funeral home before, I talked to my former colleagues and they too had problems making condolence posters because the family wanted everything in a male name. Unfortunately her family has never accepted her ... and it is precisely for this reason that she suffered"".
>
> ""Using her male name is an offense to the identity with which everyone knew her"": this is how @taffofuneralservices decided to offer her enormous media exposure for the final, and most respectful, greeting to GIANNA, the transgender person of Andria passed away in recent days apparently due to an accidental fall on which investigations are still underway by the Carabinieri.

She had survived an attempted assassination by her own brother in November 2020, and at the time of her death she was homeless.

> Influencer Ygona Moura died last night, aged 23, after spending days in hospital for complications caused by covid-19. Her body was buried today at 11 am, in the cemetery of Vila Formosa, in the East Zone of São Paulo.
> 
> Ygona went viral on social media for sharing funny videos and also making fun of the agglomerations she participated in during the pandemic, but her story is much more tragic than it looks.
> 
> Assuming she was gay at 16, Ygona reported that she had difficulty finding a job because she was black and fat. In addition, she lived on a war footing with her mother, who did not accept her. ""At home, my mother says she accepts my sexual option, but she has even denied me a plate of food just because I was out of work,"" recalled Ygona, in an interview with National Geographic in December.
> 
> At 20, she discovered she was trans and ended up looking for prostitution. ""I got my first wig, got on and never stopped. It was a way to learn and appreciate myself too, I never believed it would attract the attention of men"", she says, in the same interview.
> 
> Shortly before the start of the pandemic, she had found a formal job, and reestablished a link with her family. But with the spread of the virus, she was fired and said that she suffered again at the hands of relatives.
> 
> With no job or perspective, Ygona became known for the funny videos she shared on Instagram. In November last year, however, the crisis peaked when she was kicked out of the home after an argument with her brother who, she said, tried to kill her as he did not accept her as trans.

> A [trans woman] who had been missing for four days was found dead by relatives at the Instituto Médico Legal (IML) in Belo Horizonte on Sunday (31).
> 
> Information shows that Michele Almeida, 45, was stabbed to death under a viaduct in the capital of Minas Gerais. Michele was a student at Transvest, an NGO coordinated by city councilwoman Duda Salabert that aims to combat transphobia and facilitate the inclusion of transgender people in society. 
> 
> According to the councilwoman, Michele's death may have been related to her marginalization.
> 
> ""According to reports, 77% of murders of [trans people] in Brazil take place with exaggerated violence, exquisite cruelty, and she was possibly murdered doing [sex work]. Because of society's prejudice about 90% of [trans women] in Brazil are unfortunately [sex workers]. That is why it is important for us to fight for the employability of [trans people] people as a way to combat this structural hatred"", she explained.
> 
> Duda Salabert said she will file a formal complaint with the Civil Police, demanding further investigations into the crime against Michele Almeida.

> Michele Almeida, my colleague and student of the @ongtransvest. Stabbing her in the neck ... She was a calm and sweet trans. The stab tore across her neck. I called her brother now and came across the transphobia: he told me that the IML is bureaucratizing the release of the body, because according to the IML ""he is a man with a woman's document, so he has to go through other processes"".
