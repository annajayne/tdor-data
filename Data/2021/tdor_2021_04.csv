> Family members of the Coordinator of Policies and Promotion of LGBT Citizenship of the Municipality of Salvador, Vida Bruno, are going to call on the Public Ministry to reopen the investigation against the owners of the restaurant Cervantes, in the capital of Bahia, due to an episode of aggression reported by him before of his death.
> 
> Vida Bruno passed away at the age of 44 on Tuesday (6), after two months in the Teresa de Lisieux Hospital. According to administrator Elton Bruno Vida, 39, his brother was the victim of complications from a head trauma suffered inside the restaurant. ""He was beaten up inside. The reason for his death was transphobia and racism,"" accused Elton, referring to the fact that his brother is black and a trans man.
> 
> According to his brother, Vida Bruno had to undergo surgery to remove a brain clot diagnosed in the imaging tests he did shortly after the episode, but which he hid from his family for almost two months. ""We only found out when he was admitted, after fainting and complaining of headaches,"" reports Elton.
> 
> The aggression Elton refers to occurred on November 29, 2020, when Vida Bruno was alone at the Cervantes restaurant. He ordered a bottle of water and a starter of mussels, became sick and asked a waitress for help. From there, the story takes on completely different versions.
> 
> Bruno claimed that the owner of the restaurant said that he could not be ill there and ordered his withdrawal. As he was unable to walk, he was reportedly beaten with a blow to the head and dragged to the door with the help of ""two strong men"". Outside the establishment, the aggressions continued - including repeatedly banging his head against the floor.
> 
> At the time, Bruno reported to G1 that he was knocked out for a few seconds after receiving a rear naked choke. ""When I came to, I asked to be released, said that I was a worker, that I worked in the city hall, but, even so, the other man came, caught me by the legs and threw me in the street"", he said.
> 
> When the owner realized it was a trans man, he opened his shirt and exposed his breasts saying: 'This is not a man! This is a black bitch. ""
> 
> Vitor Viana, the lawyer for the restaurant, says that Vida Bruno had a seizure with bleeding from the nose and was immediately rescued by Cervantes employees and by two doctors who were at the scene. Disoriented, he left the establishment kicking the furniture and refused to be helped by Samu.
> 
> The family, however, says he had no history of a seizure. ""What happened was food poisoning, and this does not cause a seizure, a state of mental disorientation. Much less the picture of aggression reported by their lawyer,"" counters Elton.

Vida was a historian and the coordinator of Policies and Promotion of LGBTI + Citizenship for the City of Salvador. He had actively fought for human rights, and was one of the founders of the LGBT Reference Center.

> The body of the ex-councilwoman was sent to the Instituto Médico Legal (IML) and so far there are no suspects for the crime. The case was referred to the State Department of Criminal Investigations (Deic) of Piracicaba where it was registered as a homicide. The wake took place this afternoon from 12pm to 3pm.
>
> Elected councilor in 2012, Madalena received 3,035 votes, having the PSDB's second best performance in that election. At the time, she had been a community leader for 25 years, being considered an icon in the city. In early 2016, Madalena asked to leave the Chamber for health reasons after discovering prostate cancer.
> 
> In the following elections, she withdrew her candidacy, saying that, in addition to health issues, she had suffered racist and homophobic assaults on social networks during her term in the legislature.

In September 2021 it was reported that a film named ""[Madalena](https://www.instagram.com/madalenaodocumentario/)"" was being made about her:

> Sensitive. Transparent. Beautiful. At a slow pace, with beautiful images of the landscapes of Bonito, Dourados and Maracaju, the film “Madalena” was screened this Wednesday night (08) at the Museum of Image and Sound (MIS), in an extra year-end session .
>
> Madiano Marcheti's first fiction feature film has as its starting point the body of Madalena being found in a soy plantation. The plot follows the story of three young people - Luziane (Natália Mazarim), Bianca (Pamella Yule) and Cristiano (Rafael de Bona), who live in different contexts in the same city. Although they don't know each other, the Magdalene spirit that flies over the city becomes a link between the three. The film denounces the constant violence in the country that kills the most LGBTQIA+ population. 
>
> Actress Chloe Milan, who played the role of Magdalene, said her character was ""a gift"". “It is very gratifying to bring this story to the public, to portray our story as a woman. It shows the reality that trans women face every day. I work during the day, I have a daytime experience. Of course, prejudice exists, but if we don't give a slap in the face, we won't be an example to others. Little by little, we keep going”.

> 
> Charles Nelson, 28, was charged with second-degree murder and armed criminal action in connection with the killing on Thursday (8 April).
> 
> Lucious’ body was found at an apartment [in the 900 block of North Main Avenue] in Springfield, Missouri. Court documents say she’d planned to meet Nelson there on Thursday morning after connecting with him on a dating site.
> 
> Witnesses said Nelson fit the description of a man who was seen driving away from the apartment after gunshots were heard. Police used text messages from Lucious’ phone to identify and arrest him the same day.
> 
> Officers found blood on his shoes and a gun in his home that matched a shell casing found at the crime scene. Nelson is now being held in the Greene County jail without bond.
> 
> The death has devastated family and friends, who paid tribute to Dominique Lucious on Facebook. “Many don’t get to live in their authentic truth,” wrote a loved one. “You were fierce, glam, and hunny gorgeous! I love you now, tomorrow and forever.”
> 
> “Our hearts are broken for Dominique, whose bright beautiful light was extinguished far too soon, and for her family facing this horrific tragedy,” the Missouri advocacy group PROMO said in a statement.
> 
> “Everyday we work to end the stigma around transgender individuals. Such stigma fuels a culture of fear: transphobia, biphobia, and homophobia sit at the intersection of racism and misogyny, and fosters violence. ⁣⁣
> 
> “If we are not working to end the societal violence that ended Dominique’s life, we are part of the problem.”
> 
> A motive for the shooting is still unclear, but tragic incidents like these are all too common. Lucious’ death is at least the 13th violent death of a trans or gender non-conforming person in 2021, a growing problem that is likely underreported.

Her body was not found until seven weeks later when the police were shamed into searching for her.

The driver involved in the incident was subsequently arrested.

> The driver allegedly involved in the hit-and-run accident that killed a 64-year-old transgender woman who went missing from an Athens psychiatric hospital on April 6 has been arrested, according to Greek media.
> 
> News website in.gr said the suspect was identified by a fingerprint on Monday. Based on information attained by ANT1, the driver has admitted his action and is expected to appear before a prosecutor.
> 
> Kalogiannis was admitted to Athens’ Dromokaiteio Psychiatric Hospital on April 6 after being assaulted in her native Lesvos by a group of local teenagers who had hounded her on numerous prior occasions before forcing their way into her home, bullying her viciously and recording the incident on their mobile phones, then posting the footage on social media.
> 
> On April 9, she was killed in a hit-and-run in the area of Palaio Faliro, in southern Athens, and transferred to Tzanneio hospital. A DNA test that was only recently ordered by the authorities ascertained that the body found at the scene of the accident was that of Dimitra Kalogiannis, born Dimitris.
> 
> One of Dimitra’s brothers, Panagiotis, is expected to file charges over anyone responsible for the delay in launching a search of his sister.
> 
> Gerasimos Kourouklis, director of Silver Alert, has said that the service was informed of Kalogiannis’ disappearance by her brother and Dromokaitio, on April 6. He then immediately filed a report to declare her missing but the police did not proceed with the case because it viewed Kalogiannis as a “fugitive” from a psychiatric institution. Dimitra was killed in the car accident three days later and by the time the search was officially launched, she was already buried as a victim of unknown identity.

Dimitra was extremely vulnerable and had been institutionalised as a teenager after coming out to her family.

> Dimitra Kalogiannis told her parents at the age of 14 that she was a girl. Her revelations were summarily dismissed and she was institutionalized.
> 
> Unknown to Dimitra, her family secertly began giving her psychotropic drugs which inhibited her functioning and thought processes. These drugs did her immeasurable harm since they were coupled with invasive and traumatic conversion regimens.
> 
> The Greek Reporter wrote that Kalogiannis was ping-ponged from chronic incarceration in clinics and years of being fed psychotropic medication to adjust the chemical makeup of her brain and nervous system. These medications were recommended to her family to treat her “mental illness” -declaring herself a female although she has the physical anatomy of a male. Fast forward 40 years and society has finally understood that gender identity and sexuality are not conditions to be fixed.
> 
> Dimitra took care her parents as they grew older on the small island of Lesvos just miles from the Turkish shore. It was becuse of that location and the influx of refugeess traveling through Turkey to Greece that we know of life and death. Her plight drew the attention of the international reporters who made two short films about her. This past December cinematographer Tzeli Hadjidimitriou uploaded a video of the interview she conducted with Kalogiannis in her home in Lesvos, titled “Mr. Dimitri and Mrs. Dimitroula.”

> The Military Police (PM) found the body of the [trans woman] Milena Massafera, on Saturday night (10), with several marks of stab wounds in a kitchenette located on Rua Coronel Luiz da Cunha, in Vila Tibério, in the west of Ribeirão Preto. This is the second case of [a trans woman] killed during programs this week alone, and the police are working on the possibility that there is a link between the deaths.
> 
> The president of the Arco Íris NGO in Ribeirão Preto, Fábio de Jesus, is calling for a broad investigation by the Civil Police in the deaths of the two [trans women], as he believes that there is a connection between the two cases. “The two [trans women] were killed with great violence. Marks all over the body, including the feet, which indicates a hate action designed to murder [trans women]. As LGBT, I also fear for my life. This cannot continue,” he said.
> 
> According to the PM, family members of the victim, whose civil name is [deadname] da Silva Vieira, called the police after finding her body in the apartment where she lived. 
> 
> According to the family, Milena's friends had called to say they were unable to speak to the [trans woman]. The family went to the place and with the help of a private locksmith they managed to gain access to the property and locate the victim who was on the floor covered in blood. The Mobile Emergency Care Service (Samu) was called and the death was confirmed at the scene. 
> 
> This is the second case of death of [a trans woman] in less than 24 hours. The first was identified on the morning of last Friday (9th), at the Avelino Alves Palma Industrial Park, in the northern area of Ribeirão Preto.

He fled the scene.

> SANTIAGO DEL ESTERO - Sofía Micaela Catán, the young trans woman who had been hospitalized for a week with burns on 50% of her body, died yesterday morning after an argument with her partner. The 24-year-old had been admitted last Saturday night. While neighbors helped her, her partner abandoned her. He took her documents and the money she had collected. Although friends and relatives of the victim speak of a transfemicide, the investigation is under the charge of prosecutor Celia Mussi.
> 
> That night, Micaela arrived at the Regional Hospital guard in the company of a neighbor, who helped her by hearing her desperate screams. She had been admitted with serious burns on her body, which she suffered when she was with her partner in the house they shared on Quinto Pasaje, in the Santa Rosa de Lima neighborhood.
> 
> Soledad Catán, the victim's sister, stated that Micaela has very serious injuries “on her face, hair, all over her torso and legs. ""In the latter part of 12 (around noon on Sunday) they told us that they had intubated her and that her lungs were compromised by the smoke she inhaled.""
> 
> According to Soledad, her sister lived with her partner - for them, the author of the injuries - for ten years. They were currently living in a place that she had lent them, since the young woman could not afford to continue paying the rent where they were.

She had been beaten with a piece of wood.

> Manaus / AM - A [trans woman], identified so far only as 'Joelma', was murdered at dawn this Saturday (24th), at around 1 am, on Rua 10 de Julho with Lobo D'Almada, in the Centro district, in the south of Manaus.
> 
> According to information provided by the team from the 24th Companhia Interativa Comunitária (Cicom), which answered the incident, the police officers were doing a routine patrol when they noticed a body lying on the floor at the address mentioned.
> 
> When they decided to get out of the car and get closer, they realized it was a possible homicide. The police quickly dispatched the team from the Mobile Emergency Service (Samu), who arrived at the scene and confirmed the death.
> 
> Police at the scene had information that the [trans woman] had possibly  been beaten several times before she died.
> 
> While the Department of Scientific Technical Police (DPTC) were at the scene undertaking forensic work on the body they found a piece of wood covered by bloodstains, indicating that was indeed beaten.

Subsequent reports named ""Joelma"" as Andresa Santos and gave some background about her.

> Andresa Santos was a woman full of dreams. She told her family that she wanted to go to Aesthetics College, because she liked the idea of ​​being able to change bodies. She also wanted to start the process of gender reassignment, and even went on to do some medical consultations. But her biggest dream was not to die early, as [trans women in Brazil] have a life expectancy of only 35 years because of the violence to which they are exposed. Despite all of this, Andresa was beaten to death on Saturday (24), in the center of Manaus, at the age of 36.
> 
> ""She went out that night to have fun. She said 'I'm going there', but she didn't come back. Then we found out that she had been murdered. They ended my sister's story. They destroyed her dreams,"" reports the victim's sister, Evalcilene Santos, in an exclusive interview to EM TEMPO .
>
> When she thinks of her sister, all Evalcilene can say is how dreamy the young woman was. Andresa lived in Maués (municipality 259 km from Manaus), but moved to the capital in November 2020, already running away from prejudice.
> 
> ""In the countryside, people called her male and she didn't like it. She wanted to be called Andresa and respected for that. When she came to Manaus, she started wanting to study and change her life, but it was very difficult without having a job because of the pandemic"", said Evalcilene.

> On April 24, 2021 a 38-year-old Black trans woman named Tiffany Thomas was shot and killed at a car wash in the Red Bird section of Dallas. According to police reports, when a police patrol sergeant was notified by a passerby of an unresponsive person lying on the ground at the car wash, the sergeant responded to the location and found the victim unresponsive and with a gunshot wound. Dallas Fire and Rescue responded and pronounced the victim deceased at the scene. Witnesses reported hearing gunshots in the area at around midnight.
> 
> There was a delay in reporting her death because her family insists she was not transgender. Tiffany was found wearing female clothing and was identified by media as a trans woman, then those tweets were removed until the Dallas PD finally released today the information that she was “known as Tiffany” while still emphasizing the family denial.
> 
> Over at PlanetTransgender, Kelli has more insight:
> 
> ""To deny that the victim was transgender because the family wants a cishet image presented is a gross injustice. This might have been a hate crime. And to refuse to investigate it with that possibility in mind will lead to more murders of transgender people in the future.
> 
> ""Tiffany’s exact identity may never be known. The trans community welcomes and affirms her under the trans umbrella, acknowledging her death. There’s no shame for someone AMAB to be wearing women’s clothing at a car wash. It certainly doesn’t mean she deserved to die. Acceeding to the family’s erasure of Tiffany is not only cowardly but a grave disservice to other trans women in Dallas. It is a shameful way to behave.""

Her birth family refused to allow LGBT+ friends to attend her funeral and buried her ""as a man"".

> Early Sunday morning, Zashy Zuely del Cid Velásquez, a 27-year-old trans woman, was on the streets, offering sexual services in San Miguel, when she was shot in the back leaving her seriously injured. The young woman asked for help and was transferred urgently to the San Juan de Dios hospital in San Miguel, 138 kilometers east of the capital. Doctors declared her dead minutes later. They said the bullet punctured her lung and caused internal bleeding.
> 
> Zashy was a makeup artist and a beauty salon owner. She was also engaged in sex work, reported Venus Nolasco, president of the Perla de Oriente Collective. “She was attacked from behind, there is no indication of the perpetrators. She asked for help and was taken to the hospital but she died because she drowned in her own blood, ”the activist told Presentes.
>
> Zashy was part of the Perla de Oriente Collective. The organization works to promote the rights of the LGBTI population in the eastern part of the country. Among their programs they have designed emergency routes to deal with reports of attacks.
> 
> According to other sources who asked not to be identified for security reasons, Zashy had also received threats. It is suspected that they came from one of the groups that is part of the Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) gang, an organization that operates in the area. The gangs in El Salvador have an intolerant macho structure towards diverse populations, causing forced displacement in the territories they control, extortion and assassinations.
> 
> “What I am aware of is that it is in the investigation phase. At the moment there are no arrests, ”an agent from the police delegation in the area told Presentes, without giving further details.

> COMCAVIS Trans issued a statement in which it stressed LGBTQ people in El Salvador should enjoy the right to life, integrity and personal security.
>
> “We suffer attacks for the simple fact of having a different sexual orientation or gender identity, which each person expresses with different patterns and gender roles,” COMCAVIS Trans Executive Director Bianca Rodríguez told the Blade.
>
> “Zashy is one more victim of that prejudice and hatred of which we are victims,” said Rodríguez, recalling del Cid’s work as a grassroots activist in San Miguel that she had been doing since 2017. “We do not want violence to continue against LGBT people, and it is for that reason we have made the corresponding call to the appropriate authorities to be diligent with investigations and (for us) to be recognized as citizens with equal rights and guarantees.”
>
> The U.N. Refugee Agency (UNHCR) has also condemned del Cid’s murder. UNHCR in an article it published explained that it, along with COMCAVIS Trans, in 2020 provided del Cid with assistance and housing after criminal elements forcibly displaced her from her home. Del Cid was enrolled in a training program for entrepreneurs and both organizations were giving her support from the framework of protection and protecting the livelihoods of internally displaced people in the country. Del Cid would have been able to work in a beauty salon in order to support herself.
>
> Community leaders in San Miguel were more united during del Cid’s wake that lasted two days, but Rodríguez told the Blade the fact her family buried her with a masculine gender expression upset them.
>
> “That process was difficult because the family did not want any LGBT people to attend, but a relative eventually allowed Colectivo Perlas de Oriente to attend,” Rodríguez added.
>
> “It is a reprehensible fact, especially because the police have not conducted a credible investigation of the case,” she added. “It is worrying because the prosecutors didn’t even know the victim’s name.”
