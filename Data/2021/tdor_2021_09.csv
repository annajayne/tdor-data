> CHICAGO, IL The National Black Justice Coalition (NBJC) mourns the death of Disaya Monaee Smith, a Black transgender woman from Chicago, Illinois. Disaya Monaee Smith’s death was initially reported by Beverly Ross on Instagram. Ross reported that Disaya Monaee Smith died on September 6th [at the Prestige Inn and Suites at 1335 E. Sibley Blvd.] in Dolton, IL. 
> 
> “We mourn the loss of Disaya Monaee Smith,” explained NBJC Deputy Executive Director Victoria Kirby York. “2021 is on track to be the deadliest year on record for transgender and non-binary people – and in Chicago, Disaya Monaee Smith’s killing marks the fourth transgender person to be murdered in the Chicago region this year alone. Illinois, Dolton, and county police departments must do more to proactively prevent the continued loss of trans lives happening across their city.”

She was an Iranian refugee who had been living in Germany for several years.

A vigil for Ella was held in Alexanderplatz five days after her death.

> BERLIN taz | Although around 200 people are standing in front of a department store on lively Alexanderplatz, there is complete silence. It is the mourning rally for Ella, as they all call her, a transsexual woman from Iran who burned herself in public on this spot last Tuesday. Little by little people emerge from the crowd and put flowers and candles down. Many people cry, some softly, some loudly. A photo, a small cross and the blue-pink-white Pride flag of transgender people were also placed here.
> 
> The 40-year-old died in hospital on Wednesday. An employee of the department store had extinguished the burning woman with a fire extinguisher and a helicopter had taken her to the hospital. According to the police, it is not known why she took her own life. For everyone present, however, it is clear that it was the daily discrimination that drove her to suicide.
> 
> “I don't want to give a political speech,” says the organizer at the beginning. Like almost everyone here, she also found out about the suicide on Twitter. ""But it's also clear that Ella left a political mandate,"" she continues. It is good to mourn together and to meet each other with appreciation.

> Why Ella set herself on fire with suicidal intent, even people who knew her have no definite answer. ""I think Germany did not meet the expectations that she had. Berlin pretends to be a free city - you are sexually and psychologically harassed on every corner."" Ella also experienced that.
> 
> The two women knew each other through Dagmar's work. For 20 years she has been a volunteer medical contact person for trans people, including refugees. Ella was introduced to her by her therapist, like many others before. 
> 
> Like so many refugees, Ella assumed that she was welcome in Germany. She hoped for another life. In a video portrait of Ella from the Offenen Kanal Magdeburg from 2019, she says: “I had a good apartment in my home town, also work, a good salary. But I couldn't live in Iran as a trans woman. ""
> 
> In Iran, homosexuality is punishable by death. As a trans woman, Ella could theoretically have lived there, but she would always have been denied social recognition. The great desire to simply be a woman was also denied her by various German training institutions. ""The first place that gave her a diploma with the correct name and gender, Ella and wife, was TÜV in Berlin,"" says Dagmar. And she adds that Ella dreamed of working at Tesla.

> 
> Brianna lived in Chicago. Her social media feed is filled with affirmative self-love content as well as observations on culture, fashion, and society. It was just like the feed of most 25 year olds. She shared a recent trip to Detroit and posted sadly about the death of a local young man in her community. Her vibrancy is palpable. And that makes her death from a gunshot wound to the head in the early morning on the Chicago sidewalk so … numbing.
> 
> As of this post, the police had no leads and issued no more information. Notification of the community was delayed – as usual – by misgendering and deadnaming Brianna. Her friends and family stepped right up on that in the midst of their grief to set the record straight, a task most families don’t have to worry about during these times.

> Our paths crossed by her mother, Isabelle, who sent me a message to share her distress and a need for leads following the death of her daughter, three days earlier. I can hardly imagine the feelings that a loving mother can have when - - writing these lines. On the other hand, I understand too much the course and the wounds which pushed Sasha to this passage to the act. Today we honor his memory on the account. His mother asked me, my conscience and my heart command me. There is a lot to see in Sasha's life. There is so much to watch in his death. And we will remember his name.
> 
> Sasha was 22 years old. Having moved to Paris from Rennes, she studied fashion and design, which were part of her passions. Soul artist, creator, photography, drawing and music also animated her.

> In our discussions, her mother describes her as ""a very strong personality, very exclusive and complete, sometimes a little 'diva' side. Very close to her big sister and faithful to her friends since kindergarten for some. She started her transition 3 years ago and has blossomed by asserting her personality ”. This, Isabelle had already underlined in her first message ""we love Sasha, her whole personality, the beautiful person she has become"". This family love has nourished each message that I received from this strong mother ""her transition brought us much closer and the whole family supported and accepted her"". I guess the strength of their bond, the strength that Sasha learned from this cocoon. This support is invaluable; it is not acquired by any trans person. Unfortunately, it is not enough to protect.

Gina Rodríguez received the subject in her room at 6 in the morning.  Two hours later, the lodging receptionist went to the guest room after her companion ran out and found her lying on the floor with two deep cuts to her abdomen.
