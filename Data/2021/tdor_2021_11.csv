> On the cusp of the 2021 Trans Day of Remembrance (TDoR), Western Pennsylvania has lost a fourth trans person to the campaign of terror haunting the lives of our trans, nonbinary, and gendernonconforming neighbors.
> 
> Angel Naira, 36, was found dead from gunshot injuries in her Aliquippa home in Beaver County. Police responded to a 911 call seeking a welfare check for Angel.
> 
> “A female says a [person] is unresponsive. Not breathing. Said the apartment was broken into,” a 911 dispatcher said in audio obtained by KDKA. “The apartment was broken into. Some sort of disturbance there.”
>
> According to her brother, she worked for home health care full time, was a graduate from Aliquippa High School, and graduated from Beaver Falls Beauty Academy. Media reports – all misgendering and deadnaming her – report she was found with gunshot injuries. Online reports suggest she was physically beaten, but that’s unclear. Pennsylvania State Police are leading the investigations.
> 
> Once again, a victim’s loved ones have to add setting the record straight with media outlets and law enforcement who are universally reporting inaccurate information. There’s very little follow up reporting on her death, no information on the investigation, nothing. It is an almost deliberate erasure of Angel entirely. I expect so much more from Pittsburgh media.

Haley Gabriella Feldmann,19,18-Nov-2002,2021_11_21_Haley-Gabriella-Feldmann.jpg,https://www.thedailybeast.com/trans-teen-haley-gabriella-feldmanns-obituary-went-viral-her-family-reflects-on-love-grief-and-anger,12-Nov-2021,,,,Beach,North Dakota,USA,46.9159866,-104.0251951,suicide,suicide,"Haley died by suicide. Although her family supported her throughout her transition, the more she learned of the hostility of some others the more she had retreated into herself.

> Haley Gabriella Feldmann was born on November 18, 2002. She was called boy and so we gave her a boy name—now a dead name. We gave her boy clothes, boy toys, boy things. We didn’t know she was our daughter and so we called her son and brother. Haley spent the first several years of her life content, within and without. She knew nothing of judgment or ridicule. She knew nothing but the love of her family, which she gave back in abundance.
> 
> During her adolescent years she retreated into herself and we lost her. She became silent . . . distant. She built formidable walls that became impossible to breach, and she stubbornly refused to grant us passage. She had begun to grow afraid of the world as she began to understand herself and who she was, and the reality of her situation became apparent. The more she learned of how the world would judge her for not being who it thought she should be, the more she withdrew. She was an atheist, unable to believe in any religion or deity that taught condemnation of her for not submitting to its beliefs of who she should be. She was a child of God, made perfectly in his image, her body only a vessel for the beautiful soul He created and with which He graced us. She laughed and she loved, and though her humor was dark, her nature was light. Her kindness, her empathy, her hope for others, and her desire to help anyone in need was a blinding light she shone on everyone but herself.
> 
> Haley gave us the gift of her truth, trusted us to see beyond her body to her soul, to believe her, and to love her. We will always be grateful for the chance to have her as she was and not who we had thought her to be. Now we call her daughter and sister and we closed ranks around her to protect her and to keep her safe from the willful ignorance that surrounds her.
> Our daughter Haley spent most days wreaking havoc on the universe, her time spent being “Imperial Empress of the Galaxies, Conqueror of Solar Systems, Creator of Planets and Nations, Destroyer of Stars”, and loving and adoring Lucy, her best friend and the Best Dog Ever, who loved and adored her in equal measure. She created her own language with a full alphabet and rules, spending years revising and perfecting it, and, in typical Haley fashion, did not leave a key. She created her own maps, detailed in geography, and her own countries, rich in their histories. She dropped out of school and then graduated before her peers, which made her immensely proud. She taught herself history, geography, politics, and never hesitated to school anyone on the finer points of each. And she was usually correct.
> 
> Haley lived most comfortably in a Discord community of just under six hundred people from all over the world, each of whom loved and adored her. We are just beginning to learn of her profound impact within the community and we are grateful they had her and she was loved by them. Her soul was radiant there, unhindered by its physical representation here which had become a prison, freeing her to breathe and be.
> 
> Haley ended her life on November 12, 2021, her pain being too great. She had grown weary of the knowledge of her reality, knowing this country and this world would never stop trying to force her to submit to its ignorance, and her family rages for her. We would’ve burned the whole world down if we’d thought it would keep her safe, and our fury and outrage is eclipsed only by our grief. We struggle against the currents that try to carry us away from love, for those currents only take us further from her. And she is far enough, already.

The country's prison system has been under a state of emergency since 29th September after the worst prison massacre recorded in the country, which took place in the same prison. [A list of those killed in the riot given to their families](https://www.facebook.com/josemiguel.alzamorabaidal/posts/1326072414484588) shows Helen as the 34th victim.

> She was 20 years old when she decided to give in to her transformation. Her preference for the feminine and her delicate treatment cost her pain, rejection, loneliness ... Nothing prevented her skin from giving space to the name she chose: Helen.
> 
> Each letter was engraved on her arm along with ink-stained stars. That is now one of the few signs to identify her remains . Helen Maldonado was murdered on the violent night of November 12, 2021, in Penitenciaría del Litoral de Ecuador. She died 17 days before her 29th birthday, while serving a 30-month prison sentence after a few grams of H.
> 
> Before the massacre, she and other trans-women asked for help. [Odalys Cayambe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gexYPdZlVA) says that they knew that a new bloody attack was being prepared and they begged for their transfer from the Peni to the priority area of ​​the Regional prison a few meters away, where serving sentences is a little more bearable for the [LGBT+] population.
> 
> “Helen is just the voice of what we have asked the State for years: respect for identity, gender expression, clothing in the prison system. We are and were there - in men's prisons - because we have a penis; the rest don't matter to them ”.
> 
> Odalys directs the Trans Community Network of Ecuador Vivir Libre, which since 2017 has supported more than 200 transsexual women who were and are incarcerated for street fights, drug use or because they are accused of robbery by clients seeking sexual services. That is how she met Helen, in ward 6. She still does not know how she got to the transitional area, where she was massacred. The torture, says Odalys, begins much earlier, as soon as they set foot in the cells. “Being inside is a matter of survival, of existing and resisting. One way of resisting is prostitution, they are forced to be slaves of the system, to be mules… ”.

Helen made her living as a hairdresser and sex worker and had been in prison for more than a year, serving a 30 month sentence in a men's prison for possession of a small quantity of heroin.
 
> Diane Rodriguez , national director of the Ecuadorian Federation of LGBTI Organizations, recalls that Helen Maldonado arrived in Guayaquil and worked in a hairdresser and also worked as a sex worker. Helen was arrested for micro-trafficking of drugs and was serving a sentence of two and a half years, according to information published by the digital medium EdicionCientonce , which also indicates that in March 2022, Helen could request a change to the semi-open rehabilitation regime , which consists of to serve the rest of the sentence outside of prison with family, labor, social or community reintegration activities.
> 
> Although Helen was not an activist in the LGBTI community, ""she knew about and was linked to organizational spaces, but she did not articulate as an activist, "" says Diane. Community members who knew her, says Diane, remember that Helen was a shy person and that her arrest was a surprise, because she was not linked to any gang.
> 
> When the massacre started, Helen was able to call her mother and tell her what was happening, Diane recalls. Helen's mother and sister lived through the ordeal of families searching for the bodies of their loved ones. Both had to identify Helen's body, first among the remains of those who were dismembered, not finding her there, they were taken with the cremated bodies, where they recognized her body.
> 
> According to a report published in Indómita , one day before the massacre, “Helen Brigitte took a photo, in profile, smiling, loose hair, shorts and a red, white and blue striped diver and sent it by WhatsApp to a group of friends with two words: ""I'm fine ."" Shots had already been heard all week in the Penitentiary.
> 
> Despite the fact that Helen was a trans woman, she was being held in a men's prison. Their story is a ""voice"", Odalys Cayambe , director of the trans organization Vivir Libres, told local media. The mistreatment that Helen received as a person of gender diversity, also happens with 60 other trans women who are in the Penitentiary , according to Cayambe told Indómita .

Eight months earlier she had been kidnapped, tortured and then thrown into the same stream by a group of men.

> The 23-year-old transgender girl, Gabriela Cabrera, was found dead on Thursday, November 11, on the banks of the San Lorenzo stream, located on calles Saturio Ríos and Fortín Arce in the city of San Lorenzo. Gabi , as her relatives affectionately called her, was a volunteer at Casa Diversa, the first home in Paraguay for LGBT victims of violence. In March of this year six men had kidnapped her, beat her and tortured her inside a vehicle , and then threw her into the San Lorenzo stream. 
> 
> Eight months later, the police found her dead in the same place. Her neighbors saw Gabi on the ground with a man crying over her motionless body. At 10:00 in the morning, they notified both the human rights activist, Yren Rotela and the family, and they went together to identify the body of the young transgender woman. According to Rotela, the person who was sleeping next to Gabi's lifeless body is Reinaldo Manuel Fernández Gonzalez, her 25-year-old partner. 
> 
> The prosecution ordered Reinaldo's arrest and an investigatory statement was taken from him, but he was detained for less than six hours. In communication with Presentes , the prosecutor Gerardo Mosqueira said that they did not detain him because they did not gather enough evidence to do so. ""We cannot accuse just to impute, we have to have elements to support an accusation,"" he said. 
> 
> However, Reinaldo stated that before finding her dead, they had had an argument. That he left her for ten minutes and that, when he returned, he found her lifeless, with a rope wrapped around her neck very close to a tree. “He told us that Gabi hung herself from the tree. That they were together, then he left the place and that when he returned he already found Gabi hanging by the tree. Then, from the fright, he jumped over it and there the rope was released and they fell to the ground together and fell asleep. That was the scene that we found, ”says Mosqueira. 
> 
> The prosecutor indicated that the forensic doctor determined in a preliminary way that it could be a case of suicide, but to determine the real cause of death, the body was subjected to an autopsy. ""Last Friday the autopsy was carried out and the result will be in two or three weeks, where it will be possible to determine whether it was a suicide or not,"" adds Mosqueira. Her family and loved ones demanded that the case be thoroughly investigated. 
> 
> For Yren it is not clear that it is a suicide. He is struck by the fact that everything happened in a period of 10 minutes, that the rope broke when they fell to the ground together and that Gabi's body did not show any signs of blows. Yren saw her for the last time on Tuesday afternoon the 9th. On that occasion, she asked her how she was and Gabi told her that he had injuries, that some men beat her at the weekend. “They humiliated me a lot,” she told Yren, who noticed that Gabi was limping on one leg. She also told her that her head hurt, a fact that Mónica, a health promoter for the Panambí Association, confirmed. 

Three days before she died Gabi had been beaten by a group of men ouside a bowling alley.

> On Saturday 13, Yren published on her social networks two videos recorded at dawn on Saturday, November 6, [three] days before Gabi's lifeless appearance, in which she is clearly seen being attacked by a group of men at the exit of a bowling alley in San Lorenzo. ""On Friday those images come to me,"" says Yren, ""when I make Gabi's death public, the people who recorded the video write to me on my social networks."" 
> 
> Gabi practiced sex work on the corner of one of the nightclubs and frequented that location. One of the people who contacted Yren with the images of that night says that, for fun, they throw a loaded champagne bottle at him and then a glass of chopp directly at her head. ""That is the one I see later when we meet days later. Then, she reacts because she felt hurt and starts throwing bottles in the middle of the road. At that moment, one of the bottles crosses and it is said that it was through a windshield ”, he says. 
> 
> One of the people who shared the video with Yren told her that they desperately called 911 but [the emergency services] never came. She was lying on the ground for more than an hour. In the video, only a woman in a black shirt is seen pushing away the people who beat her and gettingg Gabi out of the way. “She was beaten by more than 10 people for 20 minutes. Those who were inside one of the clubs filmed and gave me the video. And there were security guards who saw everything and did not defend Gabi, ”says the activist. 


Gabi liked to dance and act. She was closely involved with [Casa Diversa](https://www.facebook.com/casadiversapy/) and was part of the artistic cast of [Transformando Realidades](https://www.juandesalazar.org.py/cine/transformando-realidades-una-obra-del-elenco-de-casa-diversa). 

[In March she had also been attacked](https://www.abc.com.py/nacionales/2021/03/08/denuncian-que-joven-trans-fue-maniatada-y-lanzada-al-arroyo-san-lorenzo):

> Around 11:00 this Monday, a 22-year-old trans woman was found on the banks of the San Lorenzo stream, in the city of the same name. The information was confirmed by activist Yren Rotela, who told TODAY that this person was tied hand and foot and gagged at the time of her rescue. After being transferred to a healthcare center for a medical inspection, it was found that this person had traces of trauma in various parts of the body such as the rib and stomach.
> 
> According to the victim's account, she was attacked between 5 and 6 in the morning by a group of unknown men, who beat her when she was on her back and left her unconscious, later placing a bag on her head before taking her into a private vehicle. After several hours disappeared, her attackers left her on the banks of the stream, a place from where she would have crawled until she reached a nearby house, being helped by the owner of the house who was in charge of calling the police, Rotela mentioned.
> 
> The trans woman attacked was a sex worker who was making her usual journey to the center of San Lorenzo, as detailed. In addition to having been beaten, it is not ruled out that the victim has also been the subject of a rape, a diagnosis that could not be precisely confirmed.

Her throat had been cut by a man she was seeing, and who subsequently confessed to killing her.

> Police Captain Pannawit Boonchum of Ban Sang Police Station was notified on Thursday that a body was found near a pond in the Ban Sang District of the province by a 76-year-old man who had gone there to bathe his feet.
> 
> When Captain Pannawit arrived at the scene there was already a rescue service in attendance. The body had been retrieved from the water where it was earlier found lying face down and floating wearing a black T-Shirt. Police have identified the victim as 24-year-old Ms Apinat Plookpluem, a [trans woman] who lived in a village located in the sub-district of Bang Taen nearby.
>
> The victim’s body is reported to have had a distinctive black Tantra tattoo on his back with five rows on the left-hand side while on the right there was a bird wing illustration. The deceased had suffered a sharp neck wound that appeared to have cut through the younger []woman’s] throat. Forensic experts estimated that the body had been in the pond for approximately three days.
> 
> Investigating police officers quickly established that the victim had previously been in contact with 26-year-old Worawat Chanthiam who resided in the Bang Nam Priao District of Chachoengsao province on the social network site Facebook. The suspect Mr Worawat was arrested by police on Thursday riding his red Honda motorcycle near his home and brought to Ban Sang Police Station.
> 
> Police have reported that he has confessed to the crime and is now being charged in connection with the killing. He said he had arranged the rendezvous with Ms Apinat, his transgender lover, at the bridge and explained to [her] that their relationship had to end. It was causing him severe difficulties at home with his wife. However, Apinat did not agree and refused to cut off all contact with the man. This had angered Mr Worawat who said he then drove his motorcycle back and forth until finally stopping. He had resolved to launch an attack on the [woman] with a sharp knife that he carried with him.
> 
> After the murder, police retrieved potential evidence at the scene including Ms Apinat’s mobile phone, shoes and the murder weapon which the killer dropped into the Bang Khanak canal. On Thursday, police brought the accused back to the scene to reenact the crime while police divers continued to work searching the pond where the body was found and the canal for evidence. Divers found the damaged smartphone underwater after being directed to the spot by the accused man.
> 
> Later, investigating reporters who contacted a friend of the deceased, discovered that he had, in the past, dated many people including other transgender partners he met on an online dating application.

Artemisa Domínguez,,,,,29-Nov-2021,tgeu/tdor2022/29-Dec-2021/Artemisa Dominguez,,,Chicoloapan,Estado de México,Mexico,19.4021404,-98.9418703,violence,beaten,"Artemisa died in hospital after being beaten by her boyfriend. Her religious family (who had beaten and humiliated by her in life) erased her identity in death.

Although we do not know the exact date of Artemisa's death she was buried on 29th November 2021.

> Today, while the lGbtiq+ Awards were being held by @ImpulseCDMX, on the periphery we buried one of our sisters, Artemisa Domínguez, who came from a fanatically religious family. From the moment Artemisa discovered her gender identity she was expelled from her home with blows and humiliations, which were repeated whenever possible by her family. A fight in a bar then caused her brain damage, and finally the beating that her boyfriend gave her sent her to the hospital where she was diagnosed brain dead.
>   
>  And there was nothing else to do, but herordeal did not end there, because even when she was dead, her family cut her hair and dressed her as a man, ""He was born a man, he was always a man and that's how we will say goodbye"" repeated her sister and mother without the slightest sign of pain.
>  
>  Her struggle in life was painful, her death even more so, and in that fateful ending she could do nothing to claim the identity that had cost her so much. It was hard to hear her 'DeadName' at every moment, they wanted to erase our sister, Artemis.
>  
>  But her memory will shine forever in our fight, a fight from the periphery, wrapped in machismo, misogyny and religious fanaticism, a fight that is rarely heard, but that resists. Artemis, sister, fly high and always shine on #nosotrans
