In January 2021 Gabriella has been interviewed by [[[altotietedigital.com.br]]](https://altotietedigital.com.br/index.php/2021/01/29/amor-dor-e-descoberta-a-vida-das-pessoas-trans/):

> Gabriella Irente, 23, is a singer and was born in Suzano. Her family is of Italian and Spanish descendants. Her transition started after she finished her studies because, according to her, it would be more difficult to start while she was studying because of the problems she would face at school. “It was a phase of self-knowledge and acceptance. In the beginning, it was very complicated by the lack of knowledge and not knowing what was happening to me”, says the singer. But something helped her a lot: the appearance of drag [performers] and trans [people] in the media. “It became much easier to understand myself,” she says.
>
> For Suzanense, the issue of work is very complicated: “When companies discover that you are trans, the vacancy magically disappears or they say that they don't need you anymore” she says. She says that the biggest difficulty is acceptance with other employees and the board. “The vast majority of companies still have a very conservative body of directors” comments the singer.
>
> Regarding prejudice, she told of one experience: “Three years ago when I started the process of transition I was prevented from using a women's dressing room in a store in the city because, at the time, I didn't have a very “feminine” appearance. Security pulled me out of the dressing room and publicly humiliated me in front of a store full of people.  I don't buy anything at that store anymore”
>
> The singer is emphatic in saying what needs to be improved for trans and the entire LGBTQI+ community: “The acceptance and understanding of people about us. We are human beings like everyone else. In addition, we also need more visibility on a daily basis” said Gabriella.

Zehava,22,,,,10-Oct-2021,,Rambam Hospital,,Haifa,Haifa,Israel,32.8329376,34.9835629,suicide,suicide,"Zehava died in hospital two days after trying to take her own life. She had fled the West Bank to escape abuse and prostitution but was denied even basic rights in Israel.

> Zehava’s body was found by police in a public park in Haifa on Friday, October 8. The 22-year-old transgender woman was found hanging, in grave condition, and was rushed to the hospital. She died two days later. The police believe she [died by] suicide.
> 
> Zehava’s life and tragic death have turned a spotlight on the hard lives of members of the LGBTQ+ community who lack permanent residency status in Israel. Life as a transgender woman in Israel is full of difficulties in any case, and there is a shortage of frameworks where members of the community can find support. But for those who lack residency status, life is nearly impossible, given the lack basic rights such as work permits, health insurance or the ability to open a bank account. All of these concerns, compounded by the fear that her residency status would not be renewed, brought Zehava to the edge of the abyss, welfare activists say.
> 
> “The state of Palestinian LGBTQ+ asylum seekers is shocking,” says Nina Halevy, an activist in the Gila project for transgender empowerment in Israel, who was working with Zehava. “The state allows them to stay here grudgingly and under impossible conditions, but they have no way to live. They’re allowed to be in the country, but they have no rights. What can they do? How can they survive? It’s the government that pushes them into prostitution. They deliberately provide insufficient aid.”
> 
> Zehava was already living in the street as a child. As a teenager she was sexually abused and exploited several times. A field worker who aided her recounted that Zehava had been forced into prostitution at a young age and had been blackmailed and threatened when she tried to object. In 2018, when she was 19-years-old, Zehava fled from a Palestinian city to Israel, and asked to be recognized as a victim of human trafficking. She was arrested several times for illegal residency and indicted four times. She was deported back to the Palestinian Authority, returned to Israel and was arrested again. A social worker attempted to get her a residency permit given her at-risk status as a member of the LGBTQ+ community.
> 
> “I want a permit to work in Israel. I’ve asked everyone, the police, the court – three times – but no one will help me,” Zehava said in court in January 2020, after being charged with living in Israel illegally. “I can’t go back to the [Palestinian] territories. If I go to prison, I’ll stay there for several months. When I’m released I’ll go back. I want to enter Israel. Nobody can give me a permit, everyone says they can’t help me, so who can help?” Her plea went unheeded, and the court sentenced her to three months in prison.

> Zehava is gone. A few days ago, phones and messages started going around in the small group that surrounded her, and had tried to accompany and assist her in her difficult way of life over the past year.
>
> In her short life, Zehava managed to experience infinite difficulties: a poor and dysfunctional family, violence, abuse and street life, numerous attempts to escape and find refuge on the so-called enlightened side of the wall, which repeatedly ended in Abu Kabir arrest and deportation back to her trauma districts in Tulkarm.
>
> Confirmation of who she was? Hardly achieved, and before any recurrence of depression, anxiety, alcohol and suicide.
>
> Shelter? At times, with great difficulty, with a lot of despair on the way (well-being? Your transphobia screams to heaven, most of all, a sham on your part)
>
> Medical rights? No.
>
> Work permit? No way?
>
> She did not give up, she fought. In our last conversation, she was optimistic, she had found a job, earns some money, maybe she will save and rent an apartment - but not really, as she is also not allowed to open a bank account ...
>
> Despite all this, Zehava was a rare flower: a very special young woman, open-eyed and dreamy, sensitive, curious, undecided, wondering about life and its meaning, wanted to study psychology, philosophy, religions and spirituality, find meaning and do good in the world. She was proud and noble-minded, and smart enough to experience in full force the understanding that the world simply does not want her, and does not assign her any place under the sun
>
> How awful that she was eventually broken, and in order to stifle the pain and despair that filled her, she turned towards her body is the violence that the world directed at her
>
> How terrible, how sad, how angry and frustrating !!!!

> We can never be defeated,
>
> Let her remembrance be a revolution.

She died by suicide, reportedly after being thrown out of her home by her mother, who did not accept her transition.

> On Thursday, the tragic death of Tayda, the daughter of David Lebón, the Argentine rock guitarist musician, was announced. The news was communicated by the panelist Franco Torchia, who had contact with her and shocked everyone, but the stupor grew in the last hours because it transpired that he had committed suicide after a bad family moment.
> 
> ""Tayda Lebón died in New York, where she had lived for many years. She was an artist at all times, intelligent at full volume and the architect of her own survival. Daughter of David Lebón. She had been asking for help for months. Even without further details. Much sadness"" , wrote the journalist in a social network post. Minutes later, the same journalist gave a shocking detail in another tweet: ""Tayda committed suicide,"" he detailed.
> 
> Tayda was an artist who, like her father, chose music and later settled in the United States to live as a tattoo artist. By then she had chosen to be a trans woman.
> 
> An artist, musician and tattoo artist, she came to New York in the mid-2000s, the city where her mother Liliana lived, trying to escape the label that the media imposed on her as 'daughter of'. ""I wanted to go to a place where nobody knew me and that what I managed to do was for myself,"" she said in an interview with La Nación in 2017.
> 
> But there his life was not easy either, since family problems appeared. “Having the family that I have, I imagined that my transition was going to be much easier, that I was going to be a good example for other families, because it is good to have the positive stories of people who were able to make a transition with the support of his family. There are a lot of people who are that lucky. ""
> 
> ""With my family, I thought I was going to be a good example. But hey, one is constantly surprised by things: half of my family did not like it. They did not write or say anything to me. I have been very surprised by many people I know that, possibly, I do not feel that they support me , ”Tayda said, without specifically mentioning her mother, who was the one who had not accepted her transition.
> 
> Tayda rented an apartment in a complex owned by her mother's husband, and she lived one floor above where they lived. According to what they say, David's daughter said she felt trapped, judged, insulted and manipulated by her mother.
> 
> Torchia had also publicly told a few years ago that Liliana not only did not accept her daughter's changes, but that she had thrown her out of her house. However, despite the distance her father was a great pillar for her and with her all the way.


Tayda had transitioned in 2017. She had a great relationship with her father, but not with her mother.

> Tayda was a tattoo artist and also a musician, like her father and mother, Lili Lagarde. In 2017, she decided to finally begin the process to transform her body by perceiving herself as a woman and defining herself as pansexual. As she had commented in an interview, she had always considered herself a woman.
> 
> In another interview, she expressed his affection for her father. "" My dad was, is and will be my best friend. With his strengths and weaknesses, as we all have. I am who I am thanks to him. I can be free because I have been allowed to be free. And that is something that I never lacked from my dad. I feel loved, always listened to. He is proud of me. Respect is what I learned from him. Tanguito was not stupid. Love is stronger! The rest is bullshit. ""
> 
> However, she had publicly stated that she did not have a good relationship with her mother, who like her lived in New York. On the Facebook page of Abolitionist Transfeminism, a post by Tayda was found which suggested that things had not been going well for her for months.

> 
> Hart, 42, was one of several Portlanders profiled by WW for a cover story about living in motel rooms at the edges of the city as a last resort before homelessness (“[Limbo Inn](https://www.wweek.com/news/city/2021/06/16/one-week-inside-three-motels-at-the-edge-of-homelessness/),” June 16, 2021). Hart’s housing insecurity started in 2016, when she began to transition from male to female.
> 
> In June, Hart was staying at a Ramada Inn next to Mall 205 in outer Southeast Portland with her 13-year-old son Caleb. They had bounced from a women’s shelter and a friend’s apartment into motels. “I’m hopeful that Caleb will make it through this,” she told WW at the time. “I don’t have much hope for myself. It’s been four years and I’m exhausted.”
> 
> Hart told WW that transitioning to a woman had cost her everything: her construction company in Hillsboro, her family and her house. (The story of how she lost her business could not be independently verified, and her family has not returned calls from WW.) Hart said her transition soured her family to her and Caleb both—now, they were on their own.

The victim was killed on Oct. 21 by a cellmate, who had the help of two other inmates to commit the crime. 
> 
> The family is seeking compensation for moral damages in the amount of R$ 100,000, in addition to material damages in the amount of 1/3 of the minimum wage up to the victim's average life expectancy, which according to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), or until the applicant's death, i.e. that of the mother of the murdered woman.
> 
> When the crime occurred, the State Department of Justice (Sejus) announced that the incident had been registered by the Civil Police (PC) as a suicide and that four inmates testified at the Department of Homicides and Protection of Persons (DHPP), which instituted a police inquiry by the Prison Crimes Police Station to investigate. The inquiry states that ""a notice of arrest in flagrante delicto"" was issued against the three detainees who participated in the crime. The family's lawyer, Antonio Fernando Moreira, defends, in the compensation claim, that no action was taken to guarantee the victim's survival, ""just a prison opening, supposedly for only LGBTI+ inmates, for [the public] to see.""
> 
> The statement is based on the fact that one of the killers declares himself to be cisgender in the National Prison Information Survey (Infopen) and that he does not belong to the LGBT+ community. According to the account given in the indemnity claim, he fired a ""narrow bang"" against the victim and held her neck for some time. Then another detainee placed his legs over the woman's legs so that she would stop struggling and making noise.
> 
> Then, the inmate who gave the ""narrow-naked choke"", still holding the victim's neck, asked a third party to take a sheet to hang her, a request that was complied with. The attacks ended only when death was confirmed. As stated in the indemnity claim, the detainee who started the violence practices martial arts and said he was motivated by the food debt. He had also tried to kill another cellmate the night before, as his intention with the crimes was to be transferred to another prison. This is not the first murder committed by the criminal, as, according to the document, in December 2019, according to a complaint filed by the Public Ministry of Espírito Santo (MPES), he beat another inmate to death at the Vila Velha II State Penitentiary (PEVV II – Xuri).
> 
> The Medium Security Penitentiary II (PSME II) was inaugurated on May 26 of this year and is the first exclusive and reference prison unit for the LGBTI+ population in Espírito Santo. It has a capacity for 296 custodians and works in the Viana complex. Its purpose is to ensure that there are no rights violations to this group.

> Jo Acker, 26, confronted the shooter on the first floor of the mall near a department store, according to a police report. The gunman, now identified as Jacob Bergquist, 27, shot Acker, and she died at the scene. Another person at the mall, Roberto Padilla Arguelles, 49, was killed, and at least four people were injured. Bergquist was taken into custody Monday and died the next day; police said there had been an “exchange of gunfire” with him.

> Acker’s partner and siblings say she died a hero; she ran toward Bergquist, hoping to stop him. “She was confronting the suspect. She was helping people be safe and get out of the way and they shot at her,” Ray Dawn, Acker’s partner of nearly three years, told the Idaho Statesman. “I was told she was helping people and saving them. ... I know she would have wanted to make everyone else safe. She would have been the first one to go down to confront somebody.”

Jo was a parent to a 3-year old daughter, loved video games and was known for her willingness to help others.

He wasn’t surprised she was a hero, he told the Statesman.

>
> A dedicated militant, a brilliant university student, prolific author and comrade, Tal identified himself as a gouine and was on all fronts or almost: anti-capitalist fights, fights against adult domination, feminist fights, emancipation fights queer, of course the anti-racist fights.
>
> Tal joined the Revolutionary Jews and Jews collective on shared findings: the violence of anti-Semitism and the absence of organization on the left to oppose it. The one of the deficiencies existing in our social camp in terms of analysis and fighting anti-Semitism. The one of the need to articulate fighting anti-Semitism and fight against all forms of oppression and exploitation. On the need also to positively reinvest justice, through the struggle, but also the rediscovering of Jewish cultural and historical heritage.
>
> Tal brought into the collective his energy, his involvement, his humanity. He participated in building public interventions of the collective. This is how he was found at the stand of the gathering in memory of Ilan Halimi in 2021. Tal was also very involved in the creation and animation of anti-Semitism trainings. As in his fights against child abuse, developing a pedagogy to train anti-racist fights was a fundamental form of action for him. He shared his knowledge, his political views, his ideas.

> Many of us recognized ourselves in his, in her journey and in what she was relentlessly fighting against: violence against children, violence of patriarchy, anti-Semitism, racism, capitalism, which translates to everyday da Our lives and in the flesh. His suicide, like the too many before him, reminds us bitterly that this mortal social order must be shot down without a change. Because this is especially the incest of which our comrade died.
> 
> His thought, his action and his revolutionary commitment, but also his bright and malicious personality will remain in our memories for a long time. He was undoubtedly an example of what our political camp can give the best.
>
> Our organization and the entire Diaspora can be very proud to have a person like Tal in their ranks. We will honor him by continuing his fight to victory.

The killer is in jail without bail, charged with first degree murder and other charges. He has a history of gun violations. Their son is with Rikkey’s family.
> 
> Rikkey died due to domestic violence, a scourge that often is overlooked in the LGBTQ community. According to HRC:
> 
> Tragically, interpersonal violence accounts for a significant number of fatalities against transgender and gender non-conforming people. In 2020, approximately seven in ten transgender and gender non-conforming people killed as a result of fatal violence were killed by an acquaintance, friend, family member or intimate partner. Unfortunately, the relationship of the victim to the killer is still unknown for close to one-third (30%) of all known cases. This means that anywhere from 44% to 74% of victims since 2013 were violently killed by someone they knew, including intimate partners, family members, friends, peers and acquaintances.
