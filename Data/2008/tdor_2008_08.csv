> A transgender woman shot during a home invasion dies ten days later. Detectives, of course, are treating this case as a homicide. Neighbors were afraid to talk on camera because the attackers are still on the loose. But one man said he found 29-year old Nakhia Williams lying on the ground outside her apartment [at the 1500 block] on West Market Street.

> Police say Williams was rushed to the hospital the morning of August 20th and died this past Saturday, the 30th.

> A family is missing a loved one.
>
> The people who called her 'friend' miss her terribly.
