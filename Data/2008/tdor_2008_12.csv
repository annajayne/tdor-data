> Jennifer Gale was found in an unresponsive state near the rear entrance of the First English Lutheran Church on Whitis Ave in Austin Texas by a staff member shortly after 7:00 am on December 17, 2008. According to an eye witness who was doing maintenance at the church, she did not respond to attempts to wake her up from where she had slept that night on a concrete ramp with little more than a sheet and some news papers. Emergency services via 911 were immediately called and first responders arrived in less than a minute from Fire Station #3 across 30th street from the church. After extended attempts to resuscitate Gale, she was pronounced dead at the scene at 8:26 AM. An autopsy later revealed that she had died from heart disease probably exacerbated by sleeping outside in near-freezing temperatures.

> Marti Bier, a policy aide for the Austin City council member Randi Shade, wrote: ""Something Jennifer would never talk about, but was a reality for her, is that she is a trans woman living in a transphobic society. Homelessness in the trans community is a really big problem, and one that goes ignored. There are no laws in Texas protecting transgender people, whether from job discrimination, housing discrimination or hate crimes,"" and ""The Salvation Army would not let her in there unless she was grouped with the men. They would make her use her male birth name and completely disregard, and disrespect, her identity as a trans woman.""
>
> Bier later partially retracted those comments, saying ""So what I wrote the other day about trans services may not have been entirely accurate. I have since spoken with people at both the ARCH and the Salvation Army here in town to learn what they do for homeless trans folks. It turns out the ARCH, while a men's only shelter, is actually pretty educated on the issues and accepts people as they present themselves. While this wouldn't have helped Jennifer Gale except for day-sleeping, it is certainly respectable. They will also provide for privacy in the restrooms/showers for trans folks. The Salvation Army on the other hand... they do apparently have a policy of non-discrimination and they do not turn trans people away, but I'm not fully sold on their ability to actually understand the issue. If they are not full they will give trans people privacy (maybe they have private quarters of some sort), but if full and they are in an overflow shelter situation, as they were Tuesday night, I am under the impression that they will assign people according to their anatomy.""

> While some local news stories seem to try to avoid using pronouns for both Elzy and Hunt, other news outlets relied on police descriptions of the couple as being two men leading “alternative lifestyles,” an unfair, inaccurate description. (See GLAAD’s Media Reference Guide for further explanation.) Blogs and online message boards are filling in the pieces of Elzy’s gender identity, and mainstream outlets are following suit. Reporter Francesca Jarosz over at the Indianapolis Star has done a great job in her coverage of the crime. Police arrested Christopher L. Conwell, 20, in conjunction with the murders Wednesday. It's been confirmed that the couple died of gunshot wounds and that Conwell was an acquaintence.

> On July 14, 2010, Christopher Conwell was found guilty of both murders and sentenced to 55 years in prison for each of the murders, so that they should serve their sentences in extension of each other. furthermore, he was given 1 year imprisonment for illegal possession of a weapon, which was to be served in extension of the 2 times 55 years imprisonment.

Although Michael was not transgender, it is believed that he was murdered because he and Taysia Elzy were lovers.

> This is Ali, an Iraqi M2F transgendered person, in the hands of the Iraqi pigs over a period of 2-3 days (note the beard growth between the beginning and end). No one has heard of her since this video was taken in December 2007. She could be dead. She is being tortured if she is still alive. They like to torture you before they murder you for another backward, barbaric, stupid bunch of religious lies and bullshit. This is what the backward, barbaric, stupid religious liar named The Wuss has murdered a million Iraqi civilians to protect. Fuck George W. (""The Wuss"" - his daddy used up ""The Wimp"") Bush.
> 
> UPDATE:  Jan 2009
> It has been reported that the Ali in this video has been murdered by the Iraqi government, along with others like her and gay men.> Update? This comment has been posted to this video, however the person who made this video available to the world is Ali, the name of the M2F person in the video is not known to us. So, we cannot confirm or disprove the comment. It certainly makes sense and follows the usual course of events.
> 
> ""Ali the Iraqi M2F was beheaded in 2008 along with two other M2F people. Since today is Transgender Remembrance Day in most places I thought you may wish to know and update the info in the video..""
