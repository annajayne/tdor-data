> This week we learned another LGBT couple was murdered in their home in Indianapolis, Ind. Taysia Elzy, 34, a transgender woman, and her boyfriend, 22-year-old [Mike Hunt](https://tdor.translivesmatter.info/reports/2008/12/26/michael-hunt_indianapolis-usa_05c9bd13) were found murdered in their home last week. Milton Lindgren, 70, and Eric Hendricks, 73, a gay couple, were murdered in their Indianapolis home this October.  Last week’s tragic double-homicide are being covered extensively over at the Bilerico Project:
>
> ""If the double slaying is a hate crime, nothing will be done about it. Indiana doesn't have a hate crimes law; instead we have a 'hate crimes reporting' law, but there is no recourse if police departments don't report to the state. The Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department stopped documenting hate crimes years ago.""
>
> While some local news stories seem to try to avoid using pronouns for both Elzy and Hunt, other news outlets relied on police descriptions of the couple as being two men leading “alternative lifestyles,” an unfair, inaccurate description. (See GLAAD’s Media Reference Guide for further explanation.) Blogs and online message boards are filling in the pieces of Elzy’s gender identity, and mainstream outlets are following suit. Reporter Francesca Jarosz over at the Indianapolis Star has done a great job in her coverage of the crime. Police arrested Christopher L. Conwell, 20, in conjunction with the murders Wednesday. It's been confirmed that the couple died of gunshot wounds and that Conwell was an acquaintence.

> On July 14, 2010, Christopher Conwell was found guilty of both murders and sentenced to 55 years in prison for each of the murders, so that they should serve their sentences in extension of each other. furthermore, he was given 1 year imprisonment for illegal possession of a weapon, which was to be served in extension of the 2 times 55 years imprisonment.

Although Michael was not transgender, it is believed that he was murdered because he and Taysia Elzy were lovers.

> This is Ali, an Iraqi M2F transgendered person, in the hands of the Iraqi pigs over a period of 2-3 days (note the beard growth between the beginning and end). No one has heard of her since this video was taken in December 2007. She could be dead. She is being tortured if she is still alive. They like to torture you before they murder you for another backward, barbaric, stupid bunch of religious lies and bullshit. This is what the backward, barbaric, stupid religious liar named The Wuss has murdered a million Iraqi civilians to protect. Fuck George W. (""The Wuss"" - his daddy used up ""The Wimp"") Bush.
> 
> UPDATE:  Jan 2009
> It has been reported that the Ali in this video has been murdered by the Iraqi government, along with others like her and gay men.> Update? This comment has been posted to this video, however the person who made this video available to the world is Ali, the name of the M2F person in the video is not known to us. So, we cannot confirm or disprove the comment. It certainly makes sense and follows the usual course of events.

> ""Ali the Iraqi M2F was beheaded in 2008 along with two other M2F people. Since today is Transgender Remembrance Day in most places I thought you may wish to know and update the info in the video..""
