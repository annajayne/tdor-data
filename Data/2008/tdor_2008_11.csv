Duanna Johnson,42,,2008_11_09_Duanna-Johnson.jpg,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/18/us/18memphis.html,9-Nov-2008,tdor.info/9 Nov 2008/Duanna Johnson,,,Memphis,Tennessee,USA,35.143378,-90.052136,violence,shot,"Duanna was shot in the head. Witnesses reported hearing gunfire and seeing three men run away. Police said they have no suspects in the murder.

At the time of her death Duanna was in the process of suing the city for police brutality.

> The videotaped beating of a transgender woman in police custody in Memphis last February led to charges against two officers and national condemnation from gay rights groups. The officers were fired, and the Police Department overhauled some of its procedures and began sensitivity training for the entire force.
> 
> But a week ago, the woman, Duanna Johnson, 43, was found fatally shot near downtown. Ms. Johnson’s death has revived scrutiny of the case as the department is under pressure to find the killer.
> 
> “Duanna Johnson’s case was tragic before, and now it’s an almost unimaginable loss,” said Jared Feuer, the Southern regional director of Amnesty International. “Her treatment demonstrates a culture of violence against transgender people that must be addressed.”
> 
> Ms. Johnson sustained a gunshot wound to the head late on Nov. 9, the police said, and officers found her body after responding to a shooting call in North Memphis. Investigators said three men were seen near the crime scene before the officers arrived, but police officials say they have no suspects, have made no arrests and do not have a motive for the killing.
> 
> Ms. Johnson’s case attracted national attention in June after local television stations obtained a grainy surveillance videotape that showed a police officer, identified as Bridges McRae, striking her repeatedly with a gloved fist with handcuffs slipped over his knuckles and pepper-spraying her in the face.
> 
> Another officer, James Swain, held down the 6-foot-5 Ms. Johnson during the assault, which occurred on Feb. 12 after she was arrested on a prostitution charge. Ms. Johnson, who was in a booking area at the Shelby County Jail in Memphis at the time of the attack, told the authorities that Officer McRae had also hurled antigay epithets at her.

Duanna's murder was the subject of a documentary titled ""Who Killed Duanna Johnson?"" (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4527122/) in 2011.

"Lateisha Green (""Teish"")",22,,2008_11_14_Lateisha-Green.jpg,https://www.niot.org/category/niot/lateisha-green,14-Nov-2008,tdor.info/14 Nov 2008/Teish (Moses) Cannon,,,Syracuse,New York,USA,43.047945,-76.147448,violence,shot,"Teish was shot by Dwight DeLee while sitting in a car outside a house party with her friend Alyssa Davis and her brother Mark Cannon. Mark was also shot but survived.

> A vigil was held last night for Lateisha Green, a 22 year-old African American transgender woman. Lateisha, also known as Teish, was murdered in Syracuse, NY. According to an article from News 10, Lateisha's family and friends as well as community members attended the vigil.
> 
> There was one friend who wanted to be at the vigil, but wasn't.
> 
> ""It's really killing me deep down inside because I want to be there with them and I can't, because they won't accept me,"" said [Lateisha Green's] friend Alyssa Davis.
> 
> Davis was with Teish when she was shot outside a party on Seymour Street Friday night. It was Davis who called Teish to come over to the house.
> 
> ""I truly do not want them to think that I had something to do with this, because with them being my friends for eight years, I would never in my life put my friends in any kind of danger,"" said Davis.
> 
> Police believe Teish was killed because she was gay, but don't believe she was lured to the party. Those at the vigil are hoping this will be a wake-up call.

In August 2009, DeeLee was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the crime.

> A New York judge has sentenced Dwight DeLee to the maximum term of 25 years in prison for the November killing of Lateisha Green, a transgender woman.
> 
> Last month, jurors found DeLee guilty of first-degree manslaughter as a hate crime in the murder of Green outside a house party in Syracuse, but the six men and six women jury rejected the more serious charge of second-degree murder.
> 
> “Today, a measure of justice has been delivered for Lateisha Green and her family with the imposition of the maximum sentence for this crime,” Michael Silverman, executive director of the Transgender Legal Defense & Education Fund (TLDEF), said in a statement.
> 
> Jurors said that DeLee, 20, only intended to seriously injure and not kill Green. The additional hate crime count added 5 years to Judge William Walsh's 25-year prison sentence. It is only the second hate crime conviction in the nation involving a transgender person. In May, a Colorado jury found Allen Andrade guilty of beating 18-year-old Angie Zapata to death with a fire extinguisher because she was transgender.
> 
> Twenty-two-year-old Lateisha Green was killed on November 14, a Friday, sitting in a car parked outside a friend's house. She, her openly gay brother Mark Cannon, and a third person were in the car while people in the home yelled gay slurs at them, police say.
> 
> “Dwight DeLee goes into the residence at 411 Seymour Street, returns with a 22 caliber rifle, puts the rifle to the driver's side window of that vehicle and fires one round,” said Syracuse Police Chief Gary Miguel. “And that one round strikes Mark Cannon in the arm, and continues on and strikes Moses Cannon [Lateisha Green] in the chest area.”
> 
> Mark Cannon, 18 at the time, managed to drive the car to the family's home for help.

Sadly DeeLee's conviction was overturned in July 2013.

> A New York appellate court in July 2013 overturned DeLee’s conviction, arguing the jury’s verdict was “inconsistent.”
> 
> “Lateisha Green was singled out and killed simply because she was transgender,” said Michael Silverman, executive director of the Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund, which represents Green’s family. “Dwight DeLee’s conviction brought a measure of justice to Teish’s family and friends. In light of today’s ruling, we urge the Onondaga County District Attorney to bring new hate crime charges against DeLee.”
