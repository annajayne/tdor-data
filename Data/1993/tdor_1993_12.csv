Larry Venzant,34,,,,19-Dec-1993,tdor.info/19 Dec 1993/Larry Venzant,"Chicago,",Illinois,USA,41.883229,-87.632398,violence,stabbed and mutilated,"Larry was stabbed repeatedly and castrated by David Feikema after Feikema discovered that she was trans.

> Feikema met [trans woman] Larry Venzant on December 19, 1993 and took [her] home to have sex. Feikema claims he believed that Venzant was a [cisgender] woman. According to Feikema, after a disagreement over what type of sex they would have, a fight ensued, leading to the fatal stabbing of Venzant. Upon learning that [she] was a [trans woman] Feikema cut off Venzant’s penis and put it into the victim’s mouth. Feikema was convicted of first degree murder, but mentally ill, and sentenced for 21-years at a correctional center where he would also receive psychiatric therapy. Feikema was paroled on March 24, 2004.
> 
> In the course of an interview Feikema says that by cutting off his penis ""I was giving Venzant what what [she] wanted, that is, being a woman ""(Dong, 1997) and emphasizes that the opinion of his madness at the time of the crime was not unanimous. Most of his interlocutors, he says, upon hearing the details of his case, usually tell him that he ""did the right thing"", whatever anyone in his situation would have done.

Although we don't know Larry's true name, we can at least acknowledge her trans identity.

> John Lotter and Tom Nissen forced Teena to leave a Christmas party and drove him to a remote area in Humboldt, where they brutally gang-raped him.
>  
> A week later, on December 31, 1993, Lotter and Nissen shot and killed Teena at point-blank range and then stabbed him, after learning that he had reported the incident to the police. The duo also murdered the other two adults in the household, Lisa Lambert and Phillip DeVine, all in front of Lambert’s eight-month-old son.
>  
> Nissen and Lotter were arrested and charged the same day. Both were found guilty of murder. Nissen received life in prison in exchange for his testimony against Lotter, and Lotter received the death penalty. (In 2015, Nebraska abolished the death penalty, thus giving Lotter a life sentence.)
> 
> The story is the subject of the Academy Award-winning 1999 film Boys Don’t Cry (starring Hilary Swank), and has brought wide attention to hate crimes against the trans community.
