> More than two years after saying a string of bodies found scattered in desolate, swampy areas from Algiers to Gramercy was the work of a serial killer, authorities Tuesday arrested longtime suspect Russell Ellwood in two of the murders.
> 
> And investigators said Ellwood, a former taxi driver, remains a key suspect in the deaths of at least nine more of the 26 victims found since 1991, most of them African-American, female and prostitutes. Jefferson Parish Sheriff Harry Lee said Tuesday as many as four other suspects are being investigated.
> 
> In formally charging Ellwood, 47, with the murders of Cheryl Lewis and Delores Mack, authorities painted the accused as a deviant who liked to inject his victims with a lethal mixture of drugs and have sex with their near-lifeless bodies before dumping them.
> 
> In several interviews with The Times-Picayune, Ellwood has insisted he never killed anyone. And Tuesday evening his attorney said the case against his client is flimsy.
> 
> But during the news conference at the St. Charles Parish Courthouse, St. Charles Parish Sheriff Greg Champagne said authorities had ample evidence to charge Ellwood with two counts of second-degree murder in the February 1993 deaths of Lewis, 30, of Bridge City, and Mack, 39, of Metairie. Their bodies were found a day apart in a canal off Louisiana 3160 in Hahnville. Traces of drugs were found in both of their bodies. Mack, a transsexual, was strangled; Lewis was asphyxiated, authorities said.
