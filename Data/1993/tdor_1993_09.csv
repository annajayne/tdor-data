Giuseppe Mandanici,,,,,16-Sep-1993,tdor.info/1993/Giuseppe Mandanici,,,Messina,Sicily,Italy,37.587794,14.155048,violence,shot,"Giuseppe was shot on 13th August 1993 by a hitman hired for 700 dollars by their father, Vincenzo Mandanici. They died in hospital 34 days later.

> Klaus Davi will meet in May the mayor of Messina, Renato Accorinti : to tell the news is the same massmediologist on his Facebook profile. The purpose? Submit a petition for the City of Messina to name a route to Giuseppe Mandanici , killed on 13 August 1993 - just 32 years old - in Mazzarrà, a small village of 1500 inhabitants in the province of Messina. Giuseppe Mandanici was killed because [they] loved dressing up and because [they were] a [sex worker] in the area .
> 
> To end up in jail, with the infamous accusation of having killed the degenerate son, [their] father Vincenzo , an established nurseryman in the area. Vincenzo was sentenced to 12 years in the first instance, later acquitted by the Court of Assizes: the man, according to the judges, would pay two assassins only to scare his son , without any real intention to kill him. The two assassins were also halved.
> 
> The young [person], injured initially with three gunshots, died of complications a few weeks later. During the period in the hospital he was joined by La Repubblica and his words still resonate more vividly than ever: "" My father is a monster. Years of threats and beatings. Already another time he had put a knife in my arm. I am still alive but I will always remain a victim. I'm just like a dog, I do not have a friend. I've never been able to date anyone, not even go into a bar without making fun of me . My mother is a victim. At first she tried to take my sides but my father had a hold on her. So she also started to beat me to make him happy "".

Although Giuseppe was reported to have been a gay man who cross-dressed, one of their friends reported that their gender identity was firmly female:

> For us adolescents, Giuseppe was one to avoid, to treat badly, to insult because it revealed [her] will to be a woman at all costs, thus putting in crisis the conception of masculinity of an entire community of Sicilian people!
> 
> How many quarrels with [her] father Vincenzo, an honest worker, who could not accept the will of [her daughter] to change his biological sex, constantly asking him to finance the surgery aimed at giving him a biological sexuality in accordance with the psychic?
> 
> The lack of acceptance by [her] family and the isolation of the Mazzarese community led [her] to assume serious rebellious attitudes that often resulted in private and even public violence.

We don't know if Giuseppe had another name, but we can at least acknowledge her true gender.
