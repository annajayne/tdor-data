> On September 13th, 2004, I was hit three times on the back of the head and neck with a blunt object, and had several abrasions along my arms, forehead, and right shoulder. I was wearing a black skirt and blouse, and a clutch bag was found near my body. My underwear was also pulled down, and police suspect that I may have been forcibly sodomized prior to death.
