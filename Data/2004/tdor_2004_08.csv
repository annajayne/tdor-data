"Tony ""Delicious"" Green",,,2004_08_13_Tony-Delicious-Green.jpg,https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Transgender-killings-an-investigative-quagmire-2568944.php,13-Aug-2004,"tdor.info/13 Aug 2004/Tony ""Delicious"" Green",San Francisco,California,USA,37.78008,-122.420168,violence,beaten,"Tony's naked body was discovered by a Bayview motel manager. She had been hog tied, strangled and asphyxiated with a plastic bag over her head, and beaten with a table leg.

> With Transgender Day of Remembrance events taking place throughout the Bay Area last weekend, the alleged murder of a transgender woman in San Francisco more than two years ago has stymied law enforcement officials, who need witnesses to come forward in order to gather more evidence in the case.
>
> Authorities are determined not to let the two-year-old murder of Tony ""Delicious"" Green, a transgender African American woman, fade away as they attempt to gather enough evidence to make a case. The case is languishing in part because of a culture of witness intimidation, according to the victim's sister.
>
> At least one of the suspects in the August 13, 2004 motel murder of Green has been seen around the Bayview District where the murder occurred. A Bayview motel manager discovered Green's naked body, hog tied, strangled, and asphyxiated, with a plastic bag over her head, and beaten with a table leg.
>
> In 2005, police arrested Earl Wright and Terrance Hall, who allegedly spent two days with Green prior to her death, but both were later released. No one has been charged in Green's murder.

Joel Robles,29,,,,15-Aug-2004,tdor.info/15 Aug 2004/Joel Robles,Fresno,California,USA,36.731654,-119.785856,violence,stabbed,"Joel was stabbed by Estanislao Martinez after he discovered that Joel was trans.

Just over a year after the murder Martinez (who attempted to use a ""gay panic"" defence) was sentenced to four years in prison for voluntary manslaughter.

> In Fresno, Estanislao [Martinez], who pleaded guilty last month to voluntary manslaughter in the August 2004 killing of [Joel] Robles, a transgender woman, was sentenced last week to four years in prison. Gay activists were angered by the relatively short sentence.
>
> Prosecutors say they agreed to the sentence because they could not have done better at trial with the evidence they had.
>
> ""One thing that it is not is a reflection of our belief that the death of this individual is properly addressed by a four-year prison sentence,"" Fresno County Assistant District Attorney Robert Ellis said.
