Penny Port,,,,,19-Dec-2004,tdor.info/19 Dec 2004/Penny Port,Sheffield,South Yorkshire,United Kingdom,53.382029,-1.465717,violence,stabbed,"Penny was stabbed to death by one of her sons during a domestic dispute.

> Domestic violence is generally seen as violence perpetrated by a male against his female partner. But statistics show that the same type of violence exists between same sex couples, between straight people and their LGBT siblings, between parents and their LGBT children and vice versa. The permutations are wide and varied. Just as domestic violence by men against their women partners used to go unreported, so too to some extent does domestic violence against LGBT people: “For LGBT people who are beaten up and abused by their partners everyday, deliberately infected with HIV, threatened with ‘outing’ or having their children removed, life is hell.” [Broken Rainbow (an LGBT domestic violence support charity) Annual Report 2004/05}.
> 
> “One of the consequences of the conspiracy of silence is that many members of our community stay in miserable and dangerous situations, unable to recognise and label their experience as ‘domestic abuse’ and look for help.” [Out in UNISON Summer 2007] This comment refers particularly to domestic violence within same sex relationships and highlights how, in a number of instances, victims of domestic violence feel ‘unable to look for help’. When the LGBT person suffering domestic violence is young the situation can lead to an even more dangerous situation – running away from home; homelessness; drugs; prostitution; suicide!
> 
> An instance of the potential conflict arising from LGBT issues that can be created within a family occurred in Sheffield in December 2004; one which led to a fatal result. A father of two teenage sons, both of whom lived with their mother, was living as a woman and taking prescribed medication whilst awaiting gender reassigning surgery. A dispute arose between [her] and [her] former wife which led to the [trans woman] entering [her] former wife’s home and during an altercation with both sons was stabbed several times by one of them. The incident was a tragic one as both sons were supportive of their father’s need to live as a woman. It was stated in the case that when presenting as a man, the victim appeared more erratic and sometimes more aggressive than when presenting as a woman. Though the son stood accused of murder, and found guilty of manslaughter, the case highlighted the complexities of understanding the emotions and behaviour of someone transitioning from one gender to another. As said in the trial, there were three victims in this unfortunate case, not one.

Neighbors heard her shouting for help and called police, but they did not arrive in time to save her. Her body was found face-down in the patio, with blood spattered around the kitchen, patio, and garage.

Her alleged killer, Pablo Corvalán, took his own life rather than face jail.

> Goshen — Robert Binenfeld was strangled in his home in Monroe on Dec. 21. That day, a man named Jason Bardsley showed up at Binenfeld's home to look at a car for sale.
>
> A woman answered the door, one thing led to another, and she performed oral sex on Bardsley, according to court papers.
>
> As Bardsley was leaving, the woman lifted her skirt. The ""woman"" was Robert Binenfeld. Bardsley told state police that Binenfeld then grabbed Bardsley's genitals. Bardsley snatched a can of spray paint with his right hand, sprayed paint into Binenfeld's eyes and grabbed Binenfeld's neck with his left hand.
>
> The next thing he knew, Binenfeld was dead.
>
> ""I didn't mean to kill him,"" Bardsley told investigators.
>
> That part of the story is told in the arid language of court papers, but the story could be played out in more detail later this year in Orange County Court if the case goes to trial.
>
> Bardsley's lawyer, Gary Greenwald of Chester, has filed notice that he plans to offer a psychiatric defense, meaning he'll argue that Bardsley was jolted into a psychiatric breakdown by the revelation that a man, not a woman, had performed oral sex on him.
>
> Bardsley, 27, of Cox Drive, Monroe, was charged with second-degree murder six days after Binenfeld's death. A Warwick cop stopped Bardsley for driving 67 mph in a 40 mph zone in Greenwood Lake. The officer also recognized Bardsley's car from a state police ""wanted"" flier.
>
> Bardsley was charged with possession of Binenfeld's credit cards, which had been used at stores in Middletown, Monroe and northern New Jersey after Binenfeld's death.
>
> Binenfeld, 65, lived on Woodland Drive in Monroe and was well known around Monroe as a flamboyant [person] with a musical bent and a knack for cooking and good conversation.

Felicia Moreno ,25,,,,26-Dec-2004,tdor.info/26 Dec 2004/Felicia Moreno,Hollywood,California,USA,34.098301,-118.325798,violence,shot,"Felicia was shot twice by a client.

Her murderer, a U.S. Marine lance corporal named Patrick Edward Vallor, was shot and killed after a standoff with police.

> Following the murder on a block near Melrose Avenue, Vallor dumped Moreno’s body in a cul-de-sac, drawing the attention of a resident who called police with a description of Vallor’s car. A helicopter responding to the call identified the car and a pursuit involving police cars ensued. When cornered by police, according to a police statement, Vallor exited his car and, after refusing to comply with orders to surrender, police fired a non-lethal beanbag round, a projectile that “affords police the opportunity to make an arrest,” said Berndt.
> 
> However, the device failed to subdue Vallor, who then drew a gun.
> 
> “Two-year veteran Officer Mario Jacinto, in fear of his safety, fired his service handgun at Vallor,” said the police department press release.
> 

> According to Vivianna Hernandez, a transgender woman who works in Los Angeles’ Gay and Lesbian Center as a victims’ advocate, Moreno self-identified as a woman, wore female clothing and used Felicia as her first name.
> 
> “She self-identified as a transgender female,” said Hernandez, who characterized Moreno as an affable person who attended meetings at an HIV prevention site set up for the Latino community.
> 
> “Compared to my age, I saw a lot of innocence and she was a humble person,” said Hernandez, who added that she was unsure if Moreno had undergone any gender reassignment surgery. Hernandez said that Moreno was an undocumented immigrant “maybe from Mexico, maybe from El Salvador,” who likely engaged in sex work in order to make money to survive.

She was a transgender woman and a member of the Navajo Nation.

Her murder remains unsolved.

> Albuquerque police are investigating the possibility a [trans sex worker] was killed when a customer realized the [person]'s gender.
>
> Last week, police found [Vera] Shey Hoskie, 23, in an alley in the 1600 block of Ridgecrest SE. When they found Hoskie, [she was] partially clothed in women's attire, police said.
>
> ""The motive is still unclear, but this is one of the theories we are investigating,"" said APD Sgt. Carlos Argueta. ""Based on [her] past, it is something that has come up.""
