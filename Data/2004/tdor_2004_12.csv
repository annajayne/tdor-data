Penny Port,,,,,19-Dec-2004,tdor.info/19 Dec 2004/Penny Port,Sheffield,South Yorkshire,United Kingdom,53.382029,-1.465717,violence,stabbed,"Penny was stabbed to death by one of her sons during a domestic dispute.

> Domestic violence is generally seen as violence perpetrated by a male against his female partner. But statistics show that the same type of violence exists between same sex couples, between straight people and their LGBT siblings, between parents and their LGBT children and vice versa. The permutations are wide and varied. Just as domestic violence by men against their women partners used to go unreported, so too to some extent does domestic violence against LGBT people: “For LGBT people who are beaten up and abused by their partners everyday, deliberately infected with HIV, threatened with ‘outing’ or having their children removed, life is hell.” [Broken Rainbow (an LGBT domestic violence support charity) Annual Report 2004/05}.
> 
> “One of the consequences of the conspiracy of silence is that many members of our community stay in miserable and dangerous situations, unable to recognise and label their experience as ‘domestic abuse’ and look for help.” [Out in UNISON Summer 2007] This comment refers particularly to domestic violence within same sex relationships and highlights how, in a number of instances, victims of domestic violence feel ‘unable to look for help’. When the LGBT person suffering domestic violence is young the situation can lead to an even more dangerous situation – running away from home; homelessness; drugs; prostitution; suicide!
> 
> An instance of the potential conflict arising from LGBT issues that can be created within a family occurred in Sheffield in December 2004; one which led to a fatal result. A father of two teenage sons, both of whom lived with their mother, was living as a woman and taking prescribed medication whilst awaiting gender reassigning surgery. A dispute arose between [her] and [her] former wife which led to the [trans woman] entering [her] former wife’s home and during an altercation with both sons was stabbed several times by one of them. The incident was a tragic one as both sons were supportive of their father’s need to live as a woman. It was stated in the case that when presenting as a man, the victim appeared more erratic and sometimes more aggressive than when presenting as a woman. Though the son stood accused of murder, and found guilty of manslaughter, the case highlighted the complexities of understanding the emotions and behaviour of someone transitioning from one gender to another. As said in the trial, there were three victims in this unfortunate case, not one.

Neighbors heard her shouting for help and called police, but they did not arrive in time to save her. Her body was found face-down in the patio, with blood spattered around the kitchen, patio, and garage.

Her alleged killer, Pablo Corvalán, took his own life rather than face jail.

Felicia Moreno ,25,,,,26-Dec-2004,tdor.info/26 Dec 2004/Felicia Moreno,Hollywood,California,USA,34.098301,-118.325798,violence,shot,"Felicia was shot twice by a client.

Her murderer, a U.S. Marine lance corporal named Patrick Edward Vallor, was shot and killed after a standoff with police.

> Following the murder on a block near Melrose Avenue, Vallor dumped Moreno’s body in a cul-de-sac, drawing the attention of a resident who called police with a description of Vallor’s car. A helicopter responding to the call identified the car and a pursuit involving police cars ensued. When cornered by police, according to a police statement, Vallor exited his car and, after refusing to comply with orders to surrender, police fired a non-lethal beanbag round, a projectile that “affords police the opportunity to make an arrest,” said Berndt.
> 
> However, the device failed to subdue Vallor, who then drew a gun.
> 
> “Two-year veteran Officer Mario Jacinto, in fear of his safety, fired his service handgun at Vallor,” said the police department press release.
> 

> According to Vivianna Hernandez, a transgender woman who works in Los Angeles’ Gay and Lesbian Center as a victims’ advocate, Moreno self-identified as a woman, wore female clothing and used Felicia as her first name.
> 
> “She self-identified as a transgender female,” said Hernandez, who characterized Moreno as an affable person who attended meetings at an HIV prevention site set up for the Latino community.
> 
> “Compared to my age, I saw a lot of innocence and she was a humble person,” said Hernandez, who added that she was unsure if Moreno had undergone any gender reassignment surgery. Hernandez said that Moreno was an undocumented immigrant “maybe from Mexico, maybe from El Salvador,” who likely engaged in sex work in order to make money to survive.
