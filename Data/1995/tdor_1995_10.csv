> I start researching the case of Steven Wilson, a 9-year-old in Middletown, Delaware, who was raped, then killed, by Lamont Harden, a 15-year- old neighbor boy. What did Steven do to deserve this? He liked to play with Barbie dolls, and other so-called ""girls' toys.""

> I can feel for Steven Wilson. I used to play with ""girls' toys"" as well, and I was taunted for it. When I was around Steven's age, I too was raped by an older boy.
