Their body was found with a plastic garbage bag wrapped around their head and multiple gunshot wounds in an alley at around 11:30pm on 2nd March.

> On an unseasonably cold Wednesday evening last year, 16-year-old Kedarie Johnson stopped by a close friend’s house to try on bras.
> 
> As the two talked, the normally jovial Burlington High School student shared that they were scared of a man named “Lumni.” They said they’d noticed a mysterious red car following them that day. They weren't sure who was behind the wheel or where the vehicle was as they spoke. 
> 
> Kedarie didn’t stay long at their friend’s house. They asked to borrow a few of the bras they’d modeled, and the friend, 15 at the time, obliged. Kedarie tucked the undergarments into their black and blue school backpack and braced against the biting wind as they walked into the night alone.
> 
> Their quick exchange was one of the last times Kedarie Johnson was seen alive.

In November 2017 a jury in Keokuk, Iowa, convicted Jorge ""Lumni"" Sanders-Galvez, 23, of first-degree murder. He was sentenced to life in prison without parole.

Ten months later Jaron Purham, 26 (who was arrested near St. Louis about two weeks after the murder driving the same red Chevrolet Impala that picked up Johnson, with the murder weapon on the floor of the driver's side seat) was also found guilty of first-degree murder. He also faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole.

> According to Anita Nelson, the Chief Executive of SRO Housing Corporation,who identified Yochum to the Times, Yochum was walking her two dogs when the alleged gunman walked up to her and shot her. After the shooting, the suspect was taken into police custody. Nelson told the Times, “It is mind-boggling; it happened in the open. I’m heartbroken. Our residents are traumatized, our staff is traumatized.” She added that “Everybody loved her. She was very popular.”

In December 2017 Daniel Molayem, 39, was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to 50 years in prison.

> Yochum’s friend Megan Lacy Wren addressed Molayem in court, telling him, “When the coroner called me to verify she had been killed, I  already knew you were the one who did it as she would express her fear of you killing her,” City News reported.
