She had been heading to a friend's party in a borrowed car on the night she was killed. According to the medical examiner, she died of blunt force trauma before the car was set alight.

> Rest in power, Goddess Diamond. Her chosen first name is not yet known, so the Advocate.com reports that Venus Selenite, a black trans feminine artist, coined the name Goddess for Diamond so that Goddess would not be referred to by her birth name in stories about her death.
> 
> We see you, Goddess. We say your name.

> Diamond had recently moved back to the area and was working at a Wal-Mart in the French Quarter. She was loved by her friends and family.
> 
> “When I asked her if she identified as a man or a woman, she told me that she would answer to both. But being that she was transitioning, I felt that it was the best to refer to her as a woman, and she agreed,” her co-worker, George Melichar, told The New Orleans Advocate. She “was very loved, and was very kind,” Melichar said. “And that’s what makes this more difficult. In addition to losing a friend, we lost an LGBT leader.”
