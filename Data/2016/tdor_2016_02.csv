>
> Jacobs posted a popular online video last year attempting to raise awareness about the difficulties of living with Asperger syndrome, a high-functioning form of autism. In the video, which was viewed more than 2.4 million times, Jacobs’ sobbed and struck [himself] while [his] Rottweiler tried to comfort her. The dog, named Samson, used his paws to block [him] from hitting [himself].

Pena was sentanced to 40-80 years for the first-degree murder of Maya and the unrelated murder of Jonathan Martel. Both had stabbed Maya, but it was the second stabbing by Pena which ultimately killed her.

> Maya Young had a distinctive birthmark: One side of her face was light and the other dark, with a line down the middle separating the brown tones.
> 
> ""She looked like chocolate and caramel,"" said Anthony Harper, a longtime friend and former roommate of the 25-year-old transgender woman. He used to call her ""Twix,"" like the candy bar. ""She was sweet, like candy. She loved people and she loved being around people,"" he said.

After the pair were sentenced Maya's sister said:

> “It’s finally over. It can never bring her back or take away the pain but, at the end of the day, I feel like she can rest better now that justice was served in her favor”.

Maya was the third known transgender woman of color killed in Philadelphia over the course of a year, after Kiesha Jenkins 22, in October 2015, and London Kiki Chanel in May 2015.

She had been beaten and possibly raped.

> The wildly beaten corpse of a 34-year-old Peruvian trans woman appeared abandoned on the street. According to the police, the victim was beaten and raped by a group of people. 
> 
> According to the newspaper Crónica published in its print edition on Tuesday, the macabre finding occurred when members of the 2nd station of Florencio Varela received a complaint, which referred to a dead person on public roads at the junction of 513 and 542, in the mentioned district, in the south of the provincial conurbano . Immediately, the members of the section arrived at the place, an opportunity in which they observed the body without life and upside down that had women's clothes. The deceased was dressed in a top, pollera, high-heeled shoes and underwear that had been lowered at the level of the thighs. The victim also had blows to her face.  
> 
> On Monday afternoon, the deceased was identified by her relatives and in this way it was established that she lived in Florencio Varela, but far from the place where she appeared dead. But this episode has mysterious elements, because the relatives indicated that the victim left his home dressed in other clothes to apparently go to a bar called Hemingway Bar, located on General José de San Martín avenue at 3200, almost corner Bartolomé Miter, in the center of the town. 
> 
> Due to these explanations of the relatives, the investigators analysed images captured by the surveillance cameras of the bar and do not rule out that the possibility that the victim was raped by the attackers, but they await the results of the expert studies.

He died at the scene.

Matthews turned himself in to local police on the day of the shooting and confessed to the killing.

Matthews originally told the police that he shot Stansberry by accident under the belief that his gun was empty after removing the clip on New Year’s Eve. However, local reports claim that Stansberry was shot at point-blank range with the shooter standing at his side.

He was charged with negligent homicide, illegal use of a weapon, and possession of a firearm by a felon.

> “We are saddened by the loss of Demarkis Stansberry, and send our condolences to his loved ones,” said Emily Waters of the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs in a statement. “We are only beginning to see national visibility around the disproportionate violence that transgender people face in this nation. Violence against transgender men has been largely missing from these conversations, and we must encourage a discussion of the unique ways that transgender men experience violence.”
> 
> Elizabeth Anne Jenkins, president of Louisiana Trans Advocates, on her Facebook page said that Stansberry was a member of her organisation.
