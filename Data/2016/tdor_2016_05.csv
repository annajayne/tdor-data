> OTD Chile regret and repudiate the terrible murder of Litzi Odalis Parrales, a trans woman who was brutally stabbed last Friday morning, May 20, in the heart of Santiago, being stabbed three times in the neck, hip and buttock.
>
> Odalis was not only murdered for being trans, but also for being a migrant. Situation that puts sex workers in a situation of greater vulnerability, being exposed to being exploited by mafias, territorial groups and the Chilean people themselves, which contributes to the job insecurity of migrants, through the delivery of work in precarious conditions or simply denying them the opportunity to work.
>
> Dedicating yourself to the sex trade should be a choice, not a social imposition derived from a situation of social vulnerability that the system imposes. Unfortunately, the crime coincides with the week in which the International Day Against Homo-Lesbo-Transphobia is commemorated and, also, it took place in Latin America, a part of the world where the most trans people have been and are murdered today.

In September 2017 Marcos Arenas Fariña was sentenced to 11 years in prison for her murder.

> The taxi driver Marcos Arenas Fariña, who on May 20, 2016 stabbed the transsexual woman Litzi Odalis Parrales in Santa Rosa with Avenida Matta, in the center of Santiago. was sentenced to 11 years in prison.
>
> The prosecutor of the Central North area, Mariela Cid, described how the victim and the taxi driver stopped at that location, but minutes later the subject returned to the vehicle from where ""he took out a knife approximately 20 centimeters in length with which he attacked and injured the victim."" in the neck area
>
> The subject then fled. The woman, who was of Ecuadorian nationality, walked several blocks until she fainted and lost her life minutes later. According to the autopsy carried out by the Legal Medical Service (SML) of the Metropolitan region, the woman was affected by anemia.

She was ignored by doctors and refused access to either the male or female wards following complaints from staff and patients. She died of her injuries on Wednesday morning.

Alisha was the Peshawar coordinator and one of eight board members of Trans Action Alliance, an advocacy group that has been increasingly vocal in seeking equal rights for transgender people in the province.

In Facebook posts, Trans Action said the gang that shot Alesha specifically targets members of the transgender community, and sometimes sexually assaults them while recording the crime.

> For an hour, while Alesha bled, doctors couldn't decide whether to admit her to the men's or women's ward, according to Trans Action. When they finally decided on the men's ward, Trans Action protested, and had her moved to the women's ward, where other women apparently complained.
> 
> Then the taunts began, Trans Action said. One doctor allegedly asked a Trans Action volunteer for her telephone number and how much she charges for a dancing party. Another was reportedly asked if her breasts were real. Another asked if the women from Trans Action just danced or also ""perform sex,"" according to the group.

In July 2019 Fazal Dayan alias Fazal Gujjar was convicted of her murder and sentenced to death. His co-accused Rehmatullah was aquitted due to a lack of evidence.

However, in February 2021 the conviction was set aside on appeal.

> PESHAWAR: A Peshawar High Court bench on Tuesday acquitted an accused person charged with murder of a transgender person Alishah, whose death had resulted into public outcry in 2016, and set aside the sentence of death awarded to him by a trial court.
>
> The bench of Justice Roohul Amin Khan and Justice Syed M Attique Shah accepted an appeal filed by the convict, Fazal Dayan alias Fazal Gujjar, ruling that the prosecution failed to prove its case against the appellant.
