Despite investigations confirming that there were traces of Itzel’s blood on Hidalgo’s clothes, he was released on 13th February 2018 as the police had allowed evidence to become contaminated.

>
> However, this trajectory was interrupted at dawn on Monday (10), near the Parque do Carmo, east of São Paulo. A friend of Yasmin, who declined to be named, said she saw her injuries from assaults and stab wounds on her body. She says she believes it to have been a crime of transphobia.
>
> The police record, however, speaks of ""suspected death."" The police reported that they were called to an incident of an “individual feeling sick” and when they arrived at Travessa Maria Morais Moreira, Yasmin was being assisted by the Fire Department, which then found her dead.
>
> The version of the police report in the 63rd Police District that the body had no signs of violence is disputed by Yasmin's friend.

She had also been beaten and stabbed.

Alessa was originally from Tabasco and was engaged in sex work to survive. She was also an activist and struggled to make visible the specific security needs of women engaged in sex work.

Just a week earlier, she had participated in the Youth Capital Forum of the Youth Institute of Mexico City, where she spoke on “Sex work: Democratisation versus precarisation”. In her speech Alessa recalled that transgender sex workers lack protection and are exposed to dangers because their work is not recognized as a job.

> “Sex work is stigmatized by the idea of selling the body, an idea that the conservatives use to disqualify them because the workers make their bodies public and (for the conservatives) the women are not public, but this idea is wrong because all the workers sell his body, the same as a worker, as well as a clerk.”

Alessa had been collaborating for two years in the placement of a day of the dead altar for sex workers, some of them murdered.

> The altar was to remember them, “remember they were here and they were very good,” Alessa said in a video recorded last year in November, just in front of the altar placed by Tlalpan’s sex workers.
> 
> “I hope I do not have to be on this poster, I hope I do not end up here and end up somewhere else, sex work is an option but I would not like to do that alone,” Alessa said in the video.
