Despite investigations confirming that there were traces of Itzel’s blood on Hidalgo’s clothes, he was released on 13th February 2018 as the police had allowed evidence to become contaminated.

> The version of the police report in the 63rd Police District that the body had no signs of violence is disputed by Yasmin's friend.

She had also been beaten and stabbed.

Alessa was originally from Tabasco and was engaged in sex work to survive. She was also an activist and struggled to make visible the specific security needs of women engaged in sex work.

Just a week earlier, she had participated in the Youth Capital Forum of the Youth Institute of Mexico City, where she spoke on “Sex work: Democratisation versus precarisation”. In her speech Alessa recalled that transgender sex workers lack protection and are exposed to dangers because their work is not recognized as a job.

> “Sex work is stigmatized by the idea of selling the body, an idea that the conservatives use to disqualify them because the workers make their bodies public and (for the conservatives) the women are not public, but this idea is wrong because all the workers sell his body, the same as a worker, as well as a clerk.”

Alessa had been collaborating for two years in the placement of a day of the dead altar for sex workers, some of them murdered.

> The altar was to remember them, “remember they were here and they were very good,” Alessa said in a video recorded last year in November, just in front of the altar placed by Tlalpan’s sex workers.
> 
> “I hope I do not have to be on this poster, I hope I do not end up here and end up somewhere else, sex work is an option but I would not like to do that alone,” Alessa said in the video.

The mother and stepfather stated they felt from the very beginning that this was a kidnapping case.

61-year-old Bruce Marchant, a convicted felon, was later apprehended by authorities in a VA hospital after a long investigation and charged with their murder. He pleaded guilty to the charges after accepting a plea bargain for additional charges related to the victim's murder.

Sierra/Simon was genderfluid and usually preferred gender-neutral pronouns.

> Sierra Bush had [their] whole life ahead of [them]. A star student who just began her first year at Boise State University, Bush was known for inspiring people to be unashamed of who they are. Fellow students said [they] made them feel safe.

> But on Sept. 24, the 18-year-old freshman—who also went by “Simon” and who, according to friends, alternated gender identities—went missing. [Their] family believed [they were] the victim of a crime; it wasn’t like the engineering major to run away or engage in risky behavior. [Their] stepfather, Bart Green, told the Idaho Statesman that he and Bush’s mother “have felt from the very beginning that this is an abduction case.”
>
> Their worst fears came true one month later, when police discovered Bush’s body in a creek about 30 miles away, outside of Idaho City. Since then, cops called [their] death “suspicious” but released few further details.
>
> On Thursday, Boise detectives flew to New York City to cuff Bush’s suspected killer, a 61-year-old felon, and charged him with kidnapping, rape and murder. The suspect, Bruce Marchant, was arrested at a VA hospital in Manhattan that afternoon, an NYPD spokesman told The Daily Beast.
>
> It’s unclear what ties, if any, Marchant has to the East Coast. An exhaustive probe, which consisted of nearly 200 interviews and crime lab results, led Boise cops to Marchant. Authorities have yet to share specifics on the case.
>

> The [trans woman] killed yesterday in an abandoned service station in Posadas was half naked and totally defenseless when they attacked her with blows to the face with a blunt object. The fact that she was drunk further complicated her chances of defending herself against a brutal relentless and lethal attacker.
>
> Evelyn Rojas (26) was found with a disfigured face near a disused filling station on avenidas Uruguay and Buchardo. Witnesses who testified said that she moved between the roundabout and that place to obtain clients.

In March 2022 Ramón Da Silva, 26, went on trial for Evelyn's murder. If convicted he faces the possibility of life imprisonment.

> Five witnesses gave evidence on the third day of oral and public evidence into the murder of Evelyn Rojas. Several of the testimonies once again brought to the fore the violence that the victim suffered from Ramón ""Ramoncito"" or ""Junior"" Da Silva, the partner of the young trans [woman] at the time and the only defendant in the case.
>
> Among the witnesses was Jeilin Rojas, Evelyn's sister who is also trans, who recounted the episodes of violence that both her and the victim suffered at the hands of Da Silva, who faces an accusation that can lead to life imprisonment.
>
> Like her sister, the girl said that throughout her life she suffered discrimination from ssionary society, as a result of which she decided to go to Buenos Aires to forge a future different from that of Evelyn, who, faced with exclusion, began to work as sex worker.
>
> Jeilin had to return to Posadas to appear as a witness before Criminal Court One. At the time of the oath, she stated forcefully: ""I have come to tell the truth about what my sister suffered.""
>
> “On many occasions I suffered discrimination and she tried to calm me down. She was always on the side of peace. We were very close, very close friends, until she met this person. There she moved away from me a little, ”the girl began her story.
>
> Jeilin then recalled the violent situations she witnessed. “It hurt me so much once when I came back from dinner and my mom told me that Evelyn had been beaten up. I was 16 or 17 years old and I entered her room. She was lying down with a rag on her face and he (Junior) was sitting next to her as if nothing had happened. I was so angry that I attacked him too, but he backed away and went back inside. I couldn't do anything but cry, ”he pointed out, his voice cracking .
>
> The young woman added that Evelyn once told her that she suffered violence from Junior, but ""she was afraid of him"" and that is why she did not want complaints to be filed. She also recalled that the man forced her sister away from her friends and her inner circle.


In mid-March 2022 Ramón Da Silva was convicted of ""homicide with femicide and a crime of gender hate and expression"" and sentenced to life in prison.

> Posadas Criminal Court No. 1 sentenced Ramón Da Silva to life in prison for homicide for femicide and a crime of gender hate and expression against Evelyn Rojas. Rojas was beaten to death by her partner in October 2016. “It is a very important precedent, especially for diversity: a before and after here in Misiones,” said the court prosecutor, Martín Rau, to Presentes.
>
> This is the first sentence for a hate crime in the province of Misiones and the second in the country, after the conviction for the travesticidio of the activist Amancay Diana Sacayan on June 18, 2018. There, the Oral Criminal and Correctional Court No. 4 of the Federal Capital sentenced Gabriel David Marino to life imprisonment.

Five years after his death, the Maine Department of Corrections paid to settle a wrongful death lawsuit by his mother.

> The mother of a transgender teen who died by suicide while incarcerated at Maine’s youth prison nearly 4 1/2 years ago has settled a wrongful death lawsuit against the Maine Department of Corrections for $225,000.
> 
> Michelle Knowles of North Vassalboro sued the department in April in U.S. District Court in Portland, alleging that despite suicide threats and attempts, staff at the Long Creek Youth Development Center in South Portland showed deliberate indifference to the serious risk that her 16-year-old son would injure himself by placing him in a cell that was neither suicide-resistant nor free of protrusions.
> 
> Charles Maise Knowles was [assigned female at birth] but identified as male. Long Creek staff found him dead in his cell on Oct. 29, 2016. He had been incarcerated at the facility since Aug. 18, 2016.
> 
> His death sparked a series of investigations into conditions at Maine’s only juvenile prison and calls for the facility’s closure. The most recent report, issued earlier this month, showed that Long Creek has failed to address issues that have plagued the facility for years. It was the third time in four years that the Center for Children’s Law and Policy, based in Washington, D.C., has investigated the conditions there.
> 
> The latest report came at the urging of a watchdog group that sounded the alarm in September over violent incidents. The report urged the state to implement some of previous recommendations, namely hiring enough of the right staff to run a safe, humane prison.
