The cause of her death was not reported.

> Her name was Carolina, she was 34 and her body was found lifeless yesterday in her apartment [on via del Cipresso in Lagaccio] in Genoa. The hypothesis that the investigators are working on is that it was a murder, even though there are no signs of violence on the body that would suggest a fight. Carolina, in fact, was found wrapped in a psorca blanket of blood and, apparently, her death dates back to a few days ago. At the moment there is no hypothesis about who could be the potential killer or the possible motive.
> 
> Unfortunately, it is yet another case of a trans person (perhaps) killed in Italy in 2016, even if it is not yet possible to say what the matrix of the murder is. For Carolina, however, there seems to be no peace even when she is dead . In fact, the usual contempt for the dignity of a person who is no longer able to defend herself is taking place on her skin.
> 
> Because Carolina was a trans and came from Ecuador. The usual, we said, because by now it is a sad refrain which it seems we cannot put an end to. Many local news sites, in fact, report the news talking about ""a transsexual"" or even ""a man"" . The fact that Carolina's photo clearly portrays a woman did not raise the slightest doubt, to those who wrote articles and titles, about the genre to use when talking about the case that concerns her. Transsexual, moreover a prostitute according to some sources (denied by a relative according to whom, instead, she was a caregiver), Carolina does not deserve the minimum respect that is due to every human being, the one that requires us to talk about peoplerespecting the gender they feel they belong to , avoiding disseminating details that are not only not functional to the news, but which in the case of trans people turn into a humiliating violation of privacy.

Carolina's death was not recorded on the TDoR 2017 memorial list released by Transgender Europe (TGEU) in November 2017.

According to the Istanbul LGBTI Association, she was a transgender woman who lost her family in the Syrian war and was working in a bar near Taksim Square.

Istanbul LGBTI activist Kivilcim Arat who met with her four days before her murder stated to KaosGL.org that:

> “We interviewed with about fifteen Syrian refugee sex worker, transgender women. Sendi was one of these women. All refugee transgender women complain of two things: intense police and 'community' violence. No documents are given to the refugees because of a recent problem in the system. The system is down. Having a legal status is the basic demand of transgender women. Actually, we met with Sendi because of this issue. We planned to give legal advice to her.”

Note that some of the news reports name Sendi as ""Werde"".

Her death was not included on the official TGEU TDoR 2017 list.

Both had been stabbed and Gabriela had also been strangled.

Both were killed by Samuele Turco - Gabriela's ex-boyfriend. After killing Kelly, he then lured Gabriela to her death by sending her a text message from Kelly's phone.

> Once again. Already there was a glimpse of some press indiscretion: Gabriela had left a man and he was persecuting her with phone calls, messages, chases. Gabriela had asked for help: she wanted to be left alone. Kelly was her friend. Gabriela was looking for support and defense: Kelly was willing to give her all this.
> 
> Two sides of a coin: life and affection on the one hand, and horror and death on the other.
> 
> Kelly was a very popular figure in Parmaand province. Originally from Langhirano, she had been the promoter of events and shows in several clubs of the city. Alongside her red light activity, she had animated the night life of the Emilian capital, especially during the 90s, when she promoted some of the trendiest and most loved clubs by young people, not only of the gay community. So today many people wanted to remember ""the Kelly"" posting a message on social media and remembering one of her irreverent jokes or even one of her many shows that, writes a friend, ""had shaken from the torpor this city still too provincial"".

Kelly's death was not included on the official TGEU TDoR 2017 list.

An inquest into her death ruled that she died by misadventure.

> Clarke told jurors she was aware that Swift had previously tried to kill herself and that she was on suicide watch, formally known as assessment care in custody teamwork (ACCT). Swift’s ACCT plan said she had to be checked on by a prison officer every 30 minutes.
> 
> Jurors were told that Swift had been taking hormone replacement treatment (HRT) drugs she had bought over the internet before she arrived at HMP Doncaster in November, five weeks before she killed herself.
> 
> Barney Branston, the barrister for Serco, which runs HMP Doncaster, suggested to Clarke that the bullying they alleged was simply a staff member being “robust”. Clarke replied: “I get that but I still saw the way she [the prison officer] was as bullying. In my view she wasn’t very professional.”
> 
> Friends and two fellow inmates told the inquest Swift struggled without the medication and was desperate to be moved to a female prison. Clarke said Swift was very upset at no longer being on HRT drugs and had told her days before her death: “I’m starting to turn back into a man.”

Jenny's death was not included on the official TGEU TDoR 2017 list.
