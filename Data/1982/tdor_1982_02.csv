Police said Dianne Aubert, 23, was found dead in her apartment early Tuesday after being stabbed 121 times. Her roommate, Maryline Grenier, 41, remained in hospital yesterday after undergoing surgery for more than 30 knife wounds. Both victims were stabbed repeatedly in the back. Police were unsure of the motive of the attackers, who were believed to have used five kitchen knives found near the victims, said police official Claude Lemire. Police confirmed that some very valuable items jewelry and furs were missing.

They found the apartment in disarray and Aubert lying naked in bed. Grenier was found partially clad in night clothes, in bed as well. Lemire said police did not realize the pair were transsexuals until their arrival at a hospital, where staff members discovered they had had sex-change operations. Lemire said police are looking for two long-haired men about 25 years old, weighing about 150 pounds and about five feet, 10 inches tall.
