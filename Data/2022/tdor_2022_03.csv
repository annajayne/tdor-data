Milo Winslow,30,,2022_03_03_Milo-Winslow.jpg,https://seeingrednebraska.com/lgbtqa/the-final-days-of-a-local-trans-activist/,3-Mar-2022,,,,Lincoln,Nebraska,USA,40.8005877,-96.7609391,suicide,suicide,"Milo died by suicide. His final social media posts show a man in great pain over the political ""debate"" taking place about the rights of trans people to exist in his city.

> Milo Winslow (he/him) died of suicide in the early morning of 3/3/2022. Those who knew Milo know that he was a fierce advocate for the trans community, and incredibly generous with his compassion and care. He put others before him and used his platform to support others going through difficulties. He was passionate about advocating for others, especially our most vulnerable youth. As someone who had experienced what many young folks are experiencing in their lives, his ability to connect with and support people touched so many. Something people may not know about Milo is just how deeply he loved. When he loves someone it is fast, deep, and everlasting. His ability to have such love in him was inspirational. The traumas he experienced in life took their toll, but still he found the capacity to love unconditionally. This is something I hope we can all learn from, both his advocacy and his ability to love.
> 
> Recently, the Fairness Ordinance set forth by the city council to update language in Title 11 of Lincoln's Municipal Code has been petitioned against by the Nebraska Family Alliance and their supporters. When the petition garnered over 18k votes in just two weeks, the despair from Milo and our trans community was palpable. To know that so many people here in our community cannot respect an individual's right to exist, much less their safety, housing, etc., was so painful to Milo.
> 
> The last year has been exceedingly tough on Milo. Between his transitional journey, the loss of friends, his mental health battles including depression and PTSD, and most recently this ongoing battle for LGBTQIA+ rights in Lincoln.....the strength Milo has shown in bearing all that came at him is beyond words. Milo will be missed so very much and our whole community suffers this loss. He would want his death to be a reminder to us all to advocate just as fiercely, love just as strongly, and to take care of ourselves and each other.

He then shot himself.

> On Saturday March 19, 2022, a 19-year-old Asian-American autistic trans woman living with mental illness issues was murdered by her father in their family home. Her father then died by suicide using the same gun.
> 
> Her name was Kathryn (Katie) Newhouse. A native of Illinois, Kathryn was most recently living with her family in Canton, Georgia. Kathryn was a Minecrat and UberSpire enthusiast, an advocate for trans rights, had a bright smile, enjoyed changing up her hair styles, and attentive to world events. She enjoyed hiking and sight seeing. She was proud of her AAPI heritage; she was of Filipino heritage. She believed the credo “Model best behavior in your own sphere, break down stereotypes, and speak out.”
> 
> Kathryn is the eighth transgender person reported as a victim of fatal violence in 2022.  She is the sixth woman of color from these neighbors and the first victim who identified as Asian-American. At age 19, she is the youngest victim this year to date. Their collective deaths come on the heels of 2021, the most violent year in recorded history with the deaths of 57 trans, non-binary, and gender nonconforming people in the United States alone. Note that the tabulation includes a significant number of reports of folx murdered in 2021. This might be confusing. Of course it is confusing. I tried to sort it out below.
> 
> On her Facebook page, Kathryn quoted Joan Didion in her profile. This quote was from a commencement address at the University of California, Riverside, in 1975: “I’m not telling you to make the world better, because I don’t think that progress is necessarily part of the package. I’m just telling you to live in it. Not just to endure it, not just to suffer it, not just to pass through it, but to live in it. To look at it. To try to get the picture. To live recklessly. To take chances. To make your own work and take pride in it. To seize the moment. And if you ask me why you should bother to do that, I could tell you that the grave’s a fine and private place, but none I think do there embrace. Nor do they sing there, or write, or argue, or see the tidal bore on the Amazon, or touch their children. And that’s what there is to do and get it while you can and good luck at it.”
>
> Rest in power, Kathryn. You absolutely deserved to still be here with us and to receive the supports you needed to live your best and brightest life. It was not up to your father or anyone else to decide what a better place would be for you. I am sorry we failed to create a world that valued and celebrated your whole self. I am sorry for your suffering. Thank you for all that you gave to our world.
> 
> May your memory be a revolution.

A vigil for Kathryn was held on the evening of Monday 4th April.

> ATLANTA — A candlelight vigil was held Monday night for a transgender woman who police say was killed by her own father.
> 
> Dozens of people showed up to honor Kathryn Newhouse, 19, in Atlanta’s Piedmont Park. She was killed in Cherokee County a couple of weeks ago.
>
> Now, Newhouse’s friends are using her tragedy to spread awareness about the threat the trans community is facing. “She was like a little sister to me. She was a real sweetheart,” [name redacted] said.
> 
> Police say Newhouse, an Asian American transgender woman, was killed by her father inside their family home last month. Investigators say her father shot and killed her before turning the gun on himself.
> 
> “I would’ve never imagined something like this happening to her,” [name redacted] said.
>
> Monday’s memorial served as more than just a tribute to Newhouse.
> 
> “I want people to realize that violence against trans people and violence against autistic people and violence against Asian Americans is real and it’s an epidemic. I don’t want stories like Kathryn’s swept under the rug. I want change and action to come from this. I think it’s important”.

> On March 9, the murder of a transgender person took place in Wuhan Paradise Walk, a large shopping center in downtown Wuhan. The victim was a transgender woman, who was killed in the afternoon with a knife by a man while she was using the men’s restroom in accordance with her biological sex.
> 
> The picture of the crime circulating on the Internet shows that the deceased was wearing women’s clothes and knee-high boots. Her clothes had been stripped off when she fell to the ground, so many netizens thought the deceased was a woman when the news first came out.
> 
> But soon the police preliminary notification which spread on Weibo revealed that the murder was committed with a knife at 3 p.m. on March 9 in the men’s restroom on the 4th floor of Paradise Walk. The 19-year-old male suspect Zhang and the 21-year-old victim Luo did not know each other before. They started a verbal dispute, resulting in a bloody violent clash. The victim died on the spot.
> 
> The police notification was issued at 5:30 p.m., and stated that Luo was [a trans woman] and an employee of a restaurant in the Paradise Walk. So many netizens understood that the deceased was a transgender woman who was using the men’s restroom based on her biological sex, and speculated that it was probably a hate crime born out of transphobia. 
> 
> After the incident, Weibo users condemned the killer and debated the issue of transgender rights in China. Some netizens posted posters calling attention to hate crimes against transgender people in China.
> 
> However, the discussion was immediately suppressed by the authorities’ Internet control department. Topics such as “Wuhan Paradise Walk murder case,” “Wuhan Paradise Walk murder,” and even simply “Wuhan Paradise Walk” were blocked. Netizens were confronted with a message that, “According to relevant laws, regulations and policies, the topic page is not displayed.” 
> 
> A transgender blogger named who had tried to generate attention for the case on Weibo, also deleted her earlier Weibo post exposing the incident, claiming that she had received a phone call from Wuhan police. “Because the suspect’s behavior was too bad and the scene was very bloody, and the suspect has been caught on the spot and is being interrogated about the motive of the crime, so to avoid the impact on the victim’s family, as well as not to affect the police investigation work, I deleted that previous microblogging, please wait patiently for the police notice,” [she] said in the comment section of Weibo.
> 
> She also posted, “Please wait patiently for the police notice, the final case results will also be posted simultaneously on the magistrate’s office site.” But at the time of this writing, Wuhan police still had not made any public statements on the matter, and the official Weibo page of Wuhan Paradise Walk had not been updated since 5:32 p.m. on March 9th. 
> 
> Bitter Winter has also received reports from several Wuhan residents being warned by police over the phone to delete their posts with videos and pictures related to this murder. Police threatened them with legal consequences if they did not remove the posts about the homicide.

Two people were subsequently arrested and confessed responsibility for the shooting.

> PESHAWAR: A man shot dead a transgender person in Jangi Mohallah area in the limits of Khan Raziq police station here on Friday.
> 
> It was the third such incident of targeting transgender persons in the province in less than a week.
> 
> A police official told Dawn that the slain transgender person identified as Mano was friends with a local identified as Sanaullah.
> 
> He said that Sanaullah got married sometime back and Mano was not happy over [her] friend’s marriage and would quarrel with him. He said that on Friday Sanaullah allegedly shot dead Mano after an argument and fled the scene.
> 
> Police have registered an FIR against the suspect.

Subsequently it emerged that Sanaullah had shot Mano dead after she asked him to repay money he had borrowed from her. She was buried by her community after her birth family refused to accept her body.

> For many days before her death, Mano, a trans woman from Peshawar, had been fretting about her expenses. Weddings were a major source of income for her and she was worried that, with the onset of Ramazan, she wouldn’t be making any money for about a month.
>
> She had a way out, but it was a difficult one. A man she had previously been romantically involved with had borrowed a sum of over Rs800,000 from her: if she could get it back, she wouldn’t have to worry about money for the foreseeable future.
>
> She decided to give it a try.
>
Last Friday afternoon, Mano made her way to a printing press in Peshawar’s Mohallah Jangi area, next to the historic Qissa Khwani Bazaar. This press was owned by Sanaullah, her former acquaintance. She approached him and explained her predicament; why she wanted her money back. He turned her down and told her to get lost, but she made it clear she wasn’t going to leave without the money she was owed. Enraged at her persistence, Sanaullah shot her dead. He escaped through the labyrinthine streets of the area.
>
> Mano’s family, which hails from the Batkhela area of Malakand, refused to even accept her body, leaving it to the local transgender community to arrange her last rites. Arzoo Khan, president of the Transgender Association KP, told Dawn that Mano’s family refused to take part in her burial, saying they wanted nothing to do with her either in life or in death.
>
> “We had to arrange people to bathe her body. Our neighbours shouldered her coffin to the graveyard where she was laid to rest.”

She had been missing since Thursday 17th March.

> “Justice for Priscilla”. That's what the posters spread by the hands of friends and family during the funeral of Priscila Santos, known as Priscila Diva, said.
>
> The 29-year-old  trans woman and resident of the Perus neighborhood in the northwest region of the city of São Paulo, was found dead last Tuesday (22/3) in the municipality of Mairiporã, in the metropolitan region. She was last seen on Thursday (17/3) when she left the house around 9pm, at the time she always used to leave for work. During her wake, her mother remembered the scene that was often repeated: “she took a walk, tossed her hair and left”. Unlike other days, on this day Priscila left the house only in flip-flops, shorts and a top, without a cell phone or documents.
> 
> “She was last seen on Rua Mogeiro, with Av. Dr Silvio de Campos, in Perus. We stayed behind her, asking a lot of people, ”says her sister Suellen Teixeira, who even went to hospitals and posted search ads on social media.
> 
> The young woman's death is still under investigation at the Franco da Rocha Police Station, in the municipality of Grande SP, where the body was taken after being found in a state of decomposition in the Mairiporã dam. The coffin was sealed, with only a photo of the young woman's face.

Priscila is remembered by her family and friends as an outgoing young woman who was always happy and smiling.

> Born on December 11, 1992, Priscila was the daughter of Dona Irene dos Santos, sister of Suellen, Luana, Diego, Taise and Diógenes. Her nephews and nieces, even without understanding her departure, cried for their aunt. All the friends I talked to during the wake said the same thing: she was high-spirited, cheerful, outgoing, playful.
> 
> ""She was a very outgoing person. Happy and smiling. She spoke well. She was always well-groomed. She was very special to many people"", says Sister Suellen Teixeira, amid the whirlwind of information and emotions.
> 
> Priscila was also an inspiration to many of them. One of her friends, Talysson Ferreira, considered her one of the first trans women in Perus.
> 
> ""I followed her trajectory and her suffering, because it wasn't easy. It's not easy for any of us. For me, she was the diva, she who started as a trans woman here in Perus. and give strength to other women, because none of them had the courage yet. She gave everyone the courage to come out and be proud to be what she is. The only queen there will be here in Perus. Our Perus diva"".

> Quinn Mowrer Gustin’s mom says Quinn loved animals more than anything. She had an affinity for stray cats, and would regularly feed them. She was always there for her friends, and always knew how to make the people around her laugh. She was unapologetically trans and queer. She was always willing to defend anyone from the hatred of the world. Quinn lost her battle with mental health on March 24.

*[Editor's Note: We don't know where Quinn passed away, but as she was from Salt Lake CIty that is the location given on this page.]*

Her family were supportive, but as every trans person knows, there is nearly always *someone* who you once trusted who lets you down. The following (extracted from an article by her mum written 5 months before her death) tells a heartening but heartbreakingly familiar story:

> November of 2017, my kiddo told me she was transgender and was a girl. This actually didn’t shock me at all – or even register too big. I kind of assumed it was a phase because of the boyfriend, but she had been prepping me over time so it wasn’t hard to hear. Honestly, I heard it but didn’t even register. I didn’t realize until about two years later that it had been her coming out moment! She didn’t feel the need to “keep it a secret” and said we could tell anyone we wanted – which, at the time, was no one!
> 
> The next month, we traveled to spend Christmas with family. I decided that my family members were the realest friends I had and I should “prep” them so that our now daughter could come out to them. The reaction from my in-laws was textbook awesome and they were SO compassionate and supportive. I went for a ride with two of my siblings and told them and they also were amazing. They expressed concern for my wellbeing but loved my kiddo unconditionally. They didn’t know anything about transgender people, but loved my daughter enough that it didn’t even matter.
> 
> Seems like a dream come true – but not quite. The hardest part came later that afternoon with our family gathering of about 20 (grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, etc). One family member, who didn’t know about my kiddo yet, because time hadn’t allowed, started talking about the “weird” cashier at the local grocery store and how they were so uncomfortable because they don’t know if “it” was a He or She. The conversation went on and on in the most horribly transphobic fashion regardless of how many times I tried to subtly steer it in a more positive way. I hadn’t yet learned to breath fire and was more worried that my kiddo had left the room when the conversation started, than I was about teaching those making the terrible remarks how damaging they were. To this day, my child prefers to not be with this family member because she feels she saw their true colors before they knew she was transgender. It didn’t matter that I had tried to stand up for trans people – my daughter was crying and angry (at me, because she could) for not being a strong enough ally for the checker who was being persecuted behind their back. My fire had been lit and I vowed never to allow that in my presence from anyone.
> 
> That fall, she was using the new name with everyone and asked all of her teachers to call her Quinn. She presented exclusively female. She broke up with the toxic boyfriend. One day, I was approached by the yearbook teacher and asked how they should list her in the yearbook. I said I thought she would prefer to be called Quinn – but I would confirm. I casually mentioned it to Quinn and asked what she wanted. She sat up from lounging gloomily on the couch and with a look of awe and wonderment asked if I really would allow her to be listed as Quinn.
> 
> You know those moments where it feels like the clouds clear, the heavens shine down radiant heavenly beams, and the angels are singing because there is PURE JOY on your child’s face? This was that moment for us! After all of the pain and turmoil and hurt, this was our moment. It was the look on your child’s face the first time they see fireworks explode in the night sky, or on Christmas morning when piles of presents have appeared, or the magical look of true love. I would never be Public Enemy #1 again, and she would be Quinn forever.
> 
> Yes, she could be listed as Quinn and once again – it was us against the world.
> 
> We fought the fight against dysphoria together. I cried with her when she didn’t recognize her own reflection as herself. I never complained when she would shower in the dark or run the steamy shower for way too long so she couldn’t see her reflection in the mirror. I waxed her eyebrows, upper lip, and armpits. I helped her get eyelash extensions and learn to straighten her hair. I still try hard to understand why sleeping in jeans is emotionally the safest, even though I don’t “get it”. After many ups and downs, in April of 2019, after she decided to graduate a year early, we decided to look into hormone options. We found a terrific doctor who really worked to educate us and help us make the best decisions. The day she got her first prescription for testosterone blockers and estrogen shots – we celebrated! It was the best day of her life up to that point!!!

Rest in power, Quinn.

> Yessi Montero, a 34-year-old trans woman, was reported missing and on March 24 they found her lifeless body with signs of torture on the side of a highway in Veracruz. That same day, a 34-year-old trans woman, whose name is unknown, was murdered on a public highway in the state of Oaxaca. More than a thousand kilometers from there, in Colima, 22-year-old Yaneth 'N' was murdered at her home on April 3. All three women had gunshot wounds. 
> 
> The Veracruz activist, Jazz Bustamante, told in an interview for Presentes that so far this year seven crimes have been committed due to prejudice in Veracruz, ""four against transgender people and three against gay [men],"" she explains. In Oaxaca there are two transfeminicides, according to press reports. In Colima, journalist Roberto Macías reported for El Punto Informativo that Yaneth's murder is the first transfemicide of the year in that state. 
> 
> The request for justice of these trans women has been kept in a low profile. Regarding this, Jazz Bustamante clarifies that both families and human rights defenders ""are afraid to raise their voices"" because they face hyper-local contexts where ""the law of criminal cells"" permeates. 
> 
> And he adds, “that does not mean that the victims do not have the support of their communities, they do have it, sometimes also from their families, from the same people from the sexual dissidents of those localities, but it is very difficult that in that context they go out to demonstrate to demand justice because their own safety is at stake.”

Yessi was a waitress and did not do sex work. Local media misgendered her and erased her identity.

> Yessi Montero was a waitress, she was 27 years old and was originally from the coastal municipality of Vega de Alatorre, Veracruz. Her family reported her disappearance and on March 24, 26 kilometers from her city of origin, in a stretch of plots in the town of Cuatro Caminos (municipality of Nautla), she was found dead; her body had signs of torture. 
> 
> “The press reported everything as if it were a man and did not see it as relevant that she was a trans woman. I saw it as relevant to tell and make his identity visible and that she was a visible trans woman in his community. I also saw it as relevant to tell how she was murdered because it was a hate crime and to determine it as such it is important to talk about the aggravating causes, the cruelty and advantage over her gender identity. Yessi Montero was tortured, her genitals were cut off, she was given the 'coup de grace', what other proof do they want that it was a hate crime?”.

Three attackers were subsequently arrested and one of them confessed to the murder. He said that Coconut was killed by accident - the actual target of the attack was another trans woman named Warha, who had lodged a police report against him.

> On March 28, Mirza-Hélène Deneuve killed herself. Many tributes have already been written and are circulating on social networks; however, it seems important to us, current or historical members of Transgrrrls, to dedicate a new one to her.
> 
> It was Mirza who created the Transgrrrls blog and the collective of the same name in the summer of 2018. Noting that there were few resources in French at the time about political issues relating to transfemininities, she had the ambition to produce these, whether by translating texts from others or by writing their own. So she set to work over the next two years, and to sign more than half of the blog articles of her various pseudonyms: Sister Mirza-Hélène, Mirza D., Ernest, Mahleneriez, Jules.
> 
> Creator and main contributor to the blog, present in the demonstrations as well as on all the zine stands of the events to which we were invited, Mirza was Transgrrrls. With her gone, definitely, it's a blog page that turns.
> 
> Beyond the blog, these are words, ideas, radical energies that continue to cross transfeminist, materialist and transpédégouine circles today. As the vials of liquid estradiol circulate more and more,  Kissing the  Trans Girls  is enthusiastically  shared in squats as well as in family planning centers and LGBTI centres; some protest signs feature Andrea Dworkin. Soon, we will read Minnie Bruce Pratt in French.
> 
> In the meantime, let's read together this poem by Kai Cheng Thom that Mirza had translated in 2020 and which remains sadly relevant:
> 
> you know, fem,
> 
> sometimes I'm so mad at you for being dead,
> 
> I could curse you / I could whine,
> 
> I could write your name on my arms, with fire and blades,
> 
> if it meant you would come back to keep me from hurting myself
> 
> (is it possible that the poetry of self-harm, self-effacement, sacrifice and martyrdom
> 
> is the only language we really shared)
> 
> I know it's selfish / I don't care / did you think of me?
> 
> and to the world of other trans girls that you left in the countryside
> 
> when you joined
> 
> The Eternal Chorus of Sad Trans Girls in Heaven? you piss off,
> 
> I needed you here, your feet in the dust
> 
> with us / I needed your breath, to remember how much / I needed your rage your art your ecstasy your violent wisdom
> 
> I needed your survival to ensure mine,
> 
> I needed a flesh and blood sister, someone who would paint my nails and yell at me
> 
> not a Dead Spiritual Ancestor to poetize /
> 
> fuck poetry, if it doesn't keep us alive,
> 
> fuck art and stories, if
> 
> it's all just an echo chamber reminding us all the time
> 
> that we are going to die,
> 
> I'm tired of the language of mourning
> 
> and I'm tired of being angry,
> 
> it's like all i can do is share these feelings & get likes,
> 
> I can talk and talk and all these words can't save anyone,
> 
> someone/anyone sing me a song of hope and life
> 
> that someone / anyone,
> 
> teaches me the art of resurrection,
> 
> i keep meeting women only after they die,
> 
> like a fairy tale character following a trail made of

> someone save me from (your)/our heritage, from this paved road
> 
> glitter and death,

By all accounts Mirza left behind huge legacy in France and she is sorely missed. The following tribute to her was received by email:

> What follows is the note left by her friends over at trrransgrrrls.wordpress.com (The website and organisation she created), translated by me (Magimilienne)
>
> Original link (in French): https://trrransgrrrls.wordpress.com/2022/04/15/pour-mirza/
>  
> ‘On March 28th, Mirza-Hélène Deneuve took her own life.
>  
> Lots of tribute posts have already been made on social media; but it still felt important to us, actual or past members of Transgrrrls, that we dedicated her one.
>  
> Mirza indeed founded the Transgrrrls blog and association in the summer of 2018. Noticing there were so few French resources related to political challenges related to transness (specifically trans women), she deeply wanted to create these same resources, either by translating already existing articles or writing her own. Following this, she worked relentlessly during the following two years, and she signed over half the blog’s articles under her different pseudonyms: Sœur Mirza-Hélène, Mirza D., Ernest, Mahleneriez and Julles.
>  
> Being the main creator and contributor, she attended many demonstrations and was on the zine stands in every event where we were invited.
> Mirza was Transgrrrls. Now, with her being now gone forever, a page is turned for us.
>  
> But it all goes much further than just the blog. It’s all about the words, the ideas, the radical energies that keep on influencing the transfem, materialist and queer environments. As the liquid estrogen flasks circulate more and more, ‘Baiser des meufs trans’ is still vividly shared, as well in the squats as in the Planned Parenthood clinics and LGBTI+ centres; some demonstration signs even reference Andrea Dworkin. Soon we’ll even read Minnie Bruce Pratt in French.’
