After his death his (supportive) family filed a lawsuit against his school alleging that they had failed to prevent or act on the treatment he had received from other students.

> The mother of a Manville High School student who died by suicide has sued the school district for allegedly not preventing the bullying of her child during the transition from being female to male.
> 
> Myles Fitzpatrick, 17, who was set to graduate in June, died by suicide in November after he was “subjected to continued severe harassment and bullying by his fellow students based upon his gender identity, including derogatory comments and having items thrown at him,” according to the lawsuit filed May 2 in Superior Court in Somerset County by his mother Danielle Warshefski.
> 
> “In our opinion, the current system let Myles down and we look forward to proving the allegations contained in the lawsuit to hopefully effectuate positive change in that regard,” said R. Daniel Bause, Warshefski’s attorney.
> 
> Manville Superintendent of Schools Jamil Maroun did not reply to a request for comment.


Myles had been transitioning since December 2020.

> In December 2020, Fitzpatrick came out as transgender and began transitioning from female to male, the lawsuit says, taking on the first name Myles.
> 
> Because of the pandemic, classes at Manville High School were held virtually during the 2020-21 school year.
> 
> But when school began in a hybrid format in September 2021, Fitzpatrick became the target of harassment, intimidation and bullying, the lawsuit charges.
> 
> He was ridiculed about his appearance and clothing and was subjected to slurs, referring to him as “she” and remarks that “he would never be a male,” the lawsuit says.
> 
> He also was frequently physically bullied in the hallways, including being pushed into lockers, having items thrown at him, being kicked and having his hair pilled, the lawsuit charges.
> 
> That behavior continued when he used the boys bathroom or locker room when he had to change clothes for gym, the lawsuit says.
> 
> On several occasions, the lawsuit alleges, those actions were committed in the presence of teachers and other staff members who did not intervene.
> 
> He then began experiencing severe depression and anxiety and engaged in self-mutilation and self-harm and attempted suicide, the lawsuit says.
> 
> Some of the acts of self-mutilation were committed at school and, the lawsuit says, educators took no action even when he displayed bloody sleeves.
> 
> His mother complained to her son’s counselor, and he reported the bullying to a teacher, the lawsuit says. But “this harassing and bullying conduct continued to escalate and apparently nothing sufficient was done,” the lawsuit alleges.

The other two victims were cisgender Chinese nationals who have not yet been identified.

Giandavide De Pau, a 51-year-old man with ties to organized crime, was subsequently arrested for the murder of all three women.

> This week a triple murder shocked the community living in Rome, Italy. Three women were found dead, including a Colombian. While more details of what happened to those three people are discovered, more details of Marta Castaño Torres have been revealed. She was a trans sex worker who lived in an apartment in that European city, in the Prati neighborhood of Rome, as detailed by the international press with information provided by local authorities. The three victims, the file says, lost their lives after being seriously injured with a sharp weapon.
> 
> The victim, as is known, was recognized as 'Yessenia'. She was found lifeless in her residence room last Thursday, around ten in the morning. Just one kilometer from the scene of this crime, the bodies of two Chinese women were found. The three women offered sexual services in that city. The Colombian, as it was learned, was 65 years old, and would have been murdered while she had sexual relations. At that moment, she was stabbed in the chest by her assailant who, apparently, would be the same victimizer as the other two women.
> 
> The Colombian, as reported by the national press, lived with a Venezuelan woman. With her, they had rented a small apartment in Rome. In that place they used as a space to serve their clients . Marta, her colleague told authorities, has an 18-year-old daughter.  Her friend observed that the Colombian woman had started [sex work] out of financial need.
> 
> In the case of the two Chinese women, as is known, one of them was 25 years old and the other 42. The older one was a pimp, while the younger one was a [sex worker]. On the day of the crime, the woman in charge of the business entered the room where the young woman was with a client after she began to scream for help. The 42-year-old woman realized that the man was about to kill the young woman, so she tried to defend her.
> 
> In the midst of the struggle, the pimp lost her life, and the young woman managed to flee to a certain extent, because the designated murderer, after murdering the owner of the business, caught up with her to murder her.

[Kelly Loving](https://tdor.translivesmatter.info/reports/2022/11/19/kelly-loving_colorado-springs-usa_5c2f24f6) was also killed in the same attack.

Anderson Lee Aldrich, 22, was subdued by patrons and held for arrest by authorities. The suspected shooter is facing five counts of first-degree murder and five counts of a bias-motivated crime causing bodily injury.

> A 28-year-old transgender bartender and entertainer has been identified as one of the five victims killed in the Colorado Springs shooting at Club Q. Daniel Aston, according to his mother Sabrina, gravitated toward the nightclub where the shooting unfolded late Saturday because ""he liked helping the LGBT community."" 
> 
> ""We are in shock, we cried for a little bit, but then you go through this phase where you are just kind of numb, and I’m sure it will hit us again,"" Aston told the Associated Press alongside her husband Jeff at their Colorado Springs home following Daniel’s death. ""I keep thinking it’s a mistake, they made a mistake, and that he is really alive,"" she added. 
> 
> Sabrina Aston said her son’s eagerness to make people laugh and cheer started as a child in Tulsa, Oklahoma, when he would don elaborate costumes such as the beast from ""Beauty and the Beast."" He would also cycle through weird hats and write plays acted out by neighborhood kids, she said.
> 
> Aston preferred dressing as a boy at a young age until teasing from other kids pushed him to try girls clothing. While Sabrina Aston enjoyed helping style her son, she said the fashion led to weight loss. ""He was miserable,"" she said. 
> 
> After coming out to his mother, he attended Northeastern State University in Tahlequah, Oklahoma, and became president of its LGBTQ club. Aston, the self-proclaimed ""Master of Silly Business,"" put on fundraisers with flashy productions.
> 
> Two years ago, Aston moved from Tulsa to Colorado Springs -- where his parents had settled -- and started at Club Q as a bartender and entertainer. His parents would join in the cheers at his shows. ""(Daniel’s shows) are great. Everybody needs to go see him,"" his mother said. ""He lit up a room, always smiling, always happy and silly,"" she said. 

In June 2024 Anderson Lee Aldrich, 24, was sentenced to life in prison without parole plus 190 years after pleading guilty to 50 federal hate crime charges.

https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/incident/2463465","Daniel Davis Aston was killed in the Club Q shooting in Colorado Springs, Colorado (USA) on 19 Nov 2022.

He was 28. #SayHisName #TransLivesMatter #TDoR",https://tdor.translivesmatter.info/reports/2022/11/19/daniel-davis-aston_colorado-springs-usa_bcffd2df
Kelly Loving,40,,2022_11_19_Kelly-Loving.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=10228295169141049&set=a.1223311219593,19-Nov-2022,tgeu/tdor2023/19-Nov-2022/Kelly Loving,Club Q,,Colorado Springs,Colorado,USA,38.8810411,-104.7606257,violence,shot,"Kelly was one of five people shot and killed (19 others being injured) in the [Club Q shooting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Springs_nightclub_shooting). [Daniel Davis Aston](https://tdor.translivesmatter.info/reports/2022/11/19/daniel-davis-aston_colorado-springs-usa_bcffd2df) was also killed in the same attack.

Friends described Loving as a person who not only wanted her friends to shine but also helped them shine. Loving’s sister, Tiffany Loving, said her sister used her body as a shield to help save a young man’s life during the shooting.

> “When the guy came in shooting, Kelly went to turn to look and it (bullet) hit her and she covered, his name is Wyatt, she covered him up,” said Tiffany Loving.
>
> Loving said that she recently got a chance to meet the young man and his parents at a fundraiser. Loving told Fox13 that she wanted to hate the man who committed the crime but said her God told her she has to love him.
>
> The 22-year-old suspect was due in court Monday. Prosecutors charged the alleged shooter with more than 300 counts, including 48 hate crimes. They charged him counts for each person known to be in the club at the time of the shooting.
>
> The gunman, 22 year old Anderson Lee Aldrich, was subdued by patrons and held for arrest by authorities. The suspected shooter is facing five counts of first-degree murder and five counts of a bias-motivated crime causing bodily injury, court records show.
>
> While police haven’t released details about the motive, the nightclub has served as a longtime safe haven for the local LGBTQ community.


At the time she was killed Kelly was on a weekend visit to Colorado Springs.

> Kelly Loving, 40, had been talking to a friend on a FaceTime call from inside Club Q just minutes before the shooting started. Natalee Skye Bingham told The New York Times that the last thing she said to Loving was: “Be safe. I love you.”
> 
> “She was like a trans mother to me. I looked up to her,” Bingham said. “In the gay community you create your families, so it’s like I lost my real mother almost.”
> 
> Bingham, 25, said Loving had only recently moved to Denver and was visiting the club while on a weekend trip to Colorado Springs.
> 
> “She was a tough woman,” Bingham said. “She taught me how it was to be a trans woman and live your life day to day.”
> 
> Loving’s sister, Tiffany Loving, offered condolences to the families who lost loved ones in the shooting as well as those struggling for acceptance in the world.
> 
> “My sister was a good person. She was loving and caring and sweet. Everyone loved her. Kelly was a wonderful person,” she said in a statement.

In June 2024 Anderson Lee Aldrich, 24, was sentenced to life in prison without parole plus 190 years after pleading guilty to 50 federal hate crime charges.

> A trans patient has died hanging himself outside the A&E (accident and emergency) department at the Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton. Matty Sheldrick, 29, from Hove, moved to the area with his dog Lola a year ago to study and live among the trans, non-binary and intersex (TNBI) community.
> 
> The Clare Project, the transgender support group, said: “He had a complex history with mental health and in autumn 2022 had a three-week stay in A&E (at the Royal Sussex). “When requiring a mental health unit stay, quite simply there were no beds for him to go to.
> 
> “During their stay, they also experienced several meltdowns due to lack of support for their access needs, despite these being made very clear (in written notes/briefing etc) by those who called an ambulance for him and his next of kin.
> 
> “Matty’s mum called the hospital nearly every day, alongside family/PA visits, in order to advocate for Matty’s needs. There were occasions where they were also questioning Matty’s gender and where they should or could go for support as they were transgender and autistic.
> 
> “Matty was discharged home after three weeks despite, during this time, Matty attempting to take their own life on site and stating they could not keep themselves safe at home. Matty shared that, during their stay in A&E, there were a couple of occasions they were forcibly restrained and one case where they were also injected with sedation despite consent not being sought.
> 
> “Over the course of the next two to three weeks following discharge, Matty had several engagements with NHS crisis team, their GP and the Clare Project where they stated they were still struggling with thoughts around suicide.
> 
> “On Halloween, Matty was called an ambulance by the Clare Project again. Paramedics attended and stated there was nowhere to go but A&E. Because of the trauma/abuse previously inflicted on Matty at A&E, he did not feel safe to go there again, only to be forcibly discharged back home.
> 
> “On Thursday 3 November, Matty called themselves an ambulance in a desperate call for help. They attended A&E and awaited a mental health capacity act assessment on Friday 4 November.
> 
> “On the Friday, Matty attempted to hang themselves in the bathroom facility of the hospital where they were intervened by staff.
> 
> “Matty had a meltdown following the distress of this and a staff member was unintentionally hurt in the process, to which the hospital called the police. The police attended and refused to arrest Matty as what they could see was a young person in much distress.
> 
> “On Friday 4 November afternoon, Matty was deemed within capacity by the mental health capacity assessment and told they had to leave A&E the following morning. That night, Matty walked through the entrance of A&E and publicly hung himself from a road sign at the opening of A&E’s driveway on Bristol Gate, no more than 30m from A&E’s front door.
> 
> “At this stage, we are uncertain how long Matty was hanging but they were found by a member of the public who called into A&E for help. Matty was resuscitated and went into cardiac arrest that resulted in serious medical complications that eventually led to their death in ICU (the Intensive Care Unit) 17 days later – only two days after the Trans Day of Remembrance 2022.

Matty’s family, GP, ourselves and the community are advocating for a full and thorough investigation.

> ”We are calling on Sussex Partnership Foundation Trust (who run mental health services) alongside University Hospitals Sussex (who operationally run A&E) to declare this a serious incident requiring investigation and for a full criminal investigation to be carried out by Sussex Police.”
> 
> The Clare Project wants an investigation to establish whether there was gross negligence and whether the handling of the case would cross the threshold for a corporate manslaughter charge.

Bekett Noble,34,,2022_11_23_Bekett-Noble.jpg,https://www.redeemer.ca/resound/in-memoriam-bekett-noble/,23-Nov-2022,,Redeemer University,,Ancaster,Ontario,Canada,43.211106,-79.9522325,suicide,suicide,"Bekett died by suicide. Their pronouns were they/them.

> As Redeemer University student Bekett Noble was in the throes of taking their own life, they left behind a heart-rending, urgent appeal for the rest of the public to take up their fight to protect LGBTQ+ rights within the community.
> 
> In an email sent to various community members, along with Redeemer officials and staff, hours before Noble passed away on the university campus Nov. 23, they stated the “ultimate goal would be a culture shift (at Redeemer) where students no longer feel protected in homophobic and transphobic treatment of other students.”
> 
> Noble’s crusade to improve the lives of LGBTQ+ students at the university shouldn’t be allowed to be forgotten, said Olive Moody, a friend of Noble’s and a fifth-year Redeemer student.
> 
> “As Bekett said, people will not change if they aren’t given the opportunity to show how their actions have affected the lives of those around them,” said Moody, during a Dec. 18 vigil on the steps of Hamilton City Hall attended by more than 350 people. “This has been a hard loss on all of us,”
> 
> Ancaster resident Megg Markettos, who considered Noble, 34, one of her family members, read Noble’s email to a hushed crowd. “Bekett was a dear friend, a family member (an aunt to her four daughters), said Markettos, who acknowledged there is “a lot of anger” within the community. “The way Bekett wants (the fight for LGBTQ+ rights) is with love.”
> 
> Markettos then played the song “Crazy” by Lost Frequencies and Zonderling, which Bekett and Markettos’ daughters had transformed into their own special anthem, and encouraged the crowd to join in and dance.
> 
> The university, said the statement, is conducting a “thorough review so we can understand the circumstances around this tragedy.” The university said it has made “important commitments to mental health” and is launching the mental health task force with a student group that includes representation from student government and members of marginalized groups on campus, such as LGBTQ+ and students who are Black, Indigenous and people of colour.
> 
> In their email, Noble urged Redeemer officials to create safe spaces where “marginalized groups of all kids can go and feel safe and those who would oppose them or make them feel unsafe are unwelcome in that one space.” Noble referenced Mohawk College’s Social Inc. as a possible model to follow.
> 
> Noble demanded that if a queer student makes a complaint about homophobic or transphobic behaviour at the university, it needs to be treated “very seriously and have real consequences for the perpetrator” rather than being ignored.
> 
> Noble also suggested training staff and faculty in trauma-informed care of marginalized populations and improved counselling for marginalized students. They said the original counselling service that Redeemer offered was eliminated.
> 
> “That was my last lifeline and when it got cut with no talk about how it might be able to exist again that was the beginning of the end,” stated Noble.
> 
> Moody, a member of the Genesis club at Redeemer University founded by Noble, said it was created to provide a “place of community, conversation and compassion. Genesis was created to provide a wider awareness of the queer community. A space for diverse voices to break ground at Redeemer.”
> 
> Moody said Genesis will “stand firm” to break ground and “lean into the discomfort of what it means to be Christian in a queer space.”
> 
> The university said in a statement it is continuing “to engage regularly with LGBTQ+ students on campus to ensure an environment of care, dignity and respect for all students as we work out our Christian mission.”
> 
> Karol De Stefano of Free Moms Hugs, which organized the vigil and asked people to wear the rainbow colours on behalf of Noble, said far too many LGBTQ+ students are facing life and death decisions because of the negative way institutions are confronting them.
> 
> “They have every right to be treated just like everybody else in the school community,” said De Stefano, as she yelled for the gathering to shout out Bekett Noble’s name. “Why are so many LGBTQ+ students not offered supports and security to be themselves?”
> 
> De Stefano referenced the attack at Gage Park in 2019 against LGBTQ+ Pride participants as a frightening reminder of what the queer and trans community have to be afraid of in Hamilton. Three years later, the LGBTQ+ community remains under attack, she said, such as Drag Storytime at Hamilton library branches being met with protests.
> 
> “We are here to magnify Bekett’s words and call for action to lead by their example,” said De Stefano. “Bekett left with a plan for action. It is us now picking up the baton.”
> 
> The vigil ended with the crowd singing to Blue Rodeo’s “Lost Together” and a minute of silence in remembrance of Noble.
> 
> “It didn’t have to come to suicide, to losing a student, but it did,” stated Noble in their email to the community. “Don’t let it happen again.”

> Carabobo.- [Deadname] Bencomo Pineda , a 24-year-old sex worker, was wearing a suit with a tight skirt, heels and a yellow wig on a corner of avenida Lara in Valencia, crossing calle Boyacá, when a motorized vehicle accompanied by a lady came up calling her by his [social name]. It was 11:30 on a Wednesday night.
> 
> After Bencomo recognized the voice she approached the vehicle without leaving the sidewalk. After greeting, he had a random conversation with her acquaintance who, in a surprise action, pointed a firearm at her. His interlocutor brushed the muzzle of the gun against his chest and pulled the trigger. The bullet pierced right through the heart, barely gaving her a chance to walk a few steps through the sanctums of closed premises before collapsing. The last thing she saw was her friend's motorcycle disappearing over the horizon of the avenue.
> 
> In conversations with relatives of the deceased, it was learned that the young [woman] lived alone in her late mother's house in La Candelaria, near the old La Concha service station. She made a living [doing sex work] at night with a group of friends, also [trans].
> 
> The main suspect in the murder has not yet been identified with whom the victim had had a business transaction. “My [sister] charged him some money that he owed her, because she had sold him some wigs. But he was tired of being charged and we believe that he killed her so as not to pay her,” said Heros Pineda, Bencomo's maternal sister.
> 
> This Thursday morning, the detectives returned to Lara Avenue to try to access the videos from the security cameras of the shops in the area, for which it is presumed that they are already about to identify the motorist and his companion.
