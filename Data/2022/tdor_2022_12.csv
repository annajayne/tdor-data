First responders tried to resuscitate her but she was already deceased.

> Day Rodas' body was discovered around 7:40 a.m. Dec. 1, between the intersection of Mulholland Highway and Decker Road, and Mulholland and Westlake Boulevard, near El Matador Beach in Malibu, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department. The remote area is in the unincorporated Santa Monica Mountains.
> 
> Preliminary information indicated that Rodas had overdosed and her body was brought to the location. The incident is being investigated as a homicide, but the exact cause of death has not been determined.
>
> Rodas' family had reported her missing after she had stopped responding to calls and messages, and her boss said she hadn't shown up for work, her sister, Susie Rodas, detailed in a GoFundMe page.
> 
> Rodas had recently moved back in with her family, who hadn't heard from her in two days.
> 
> The family got a call from authorities saying they had found a body that matched Rodas’ description.

Day's sister described her as ""respectful and forgiving"":

> ""She recently started living her life authentically as she came out to friends and family about being a trans woman. She was the most forgiving person who strongly advocated for lgtbq rights,"" Susie Rodas added. ""After being afraid for 27 years, she only got to live freely without fear for only six months which breaks our hearts.""

Police believe Rodas overdosed and her body was left along the road in the unincorporated Santa Monica Mountains north of El Matador Beach in Malibu. The investigation is continuing as a homicide investigation.

This is the first time a suspect has been prosecuted for femicide against a trans woman in Mexico.

Note that the date and location of her murder is not known - the report only came to light as a result of a press conference about the femicide charge by the Mexican Attorney General.

> ""We managed to get a control judge, for the first time in Mexico City, to link a man to the trial for his probable participation in the crime of femicide, to the detriment of a person who is a member of the LGBTIQ+ community, with a trans identity,"" Ernestina Godoy, Attorney General of Justice of the capital declared this Thursday.
> 
> The Femicide Investigation Prosecutor began the investigation after the discovery of the victim's body near the Rio de los Remedios according to Godoy in a message to the media. ""From the testimonies collected and the intelligence work we carried out, it was possible to point to her sentimental partner, Gustavo 'N' as the person who possibly attacked the victim with an object, after they had argued,"" the prosecutor explained. 
> 
> The Prosecutor's Office determined that, after the death of the woman, whose name was not revealed, the defendant allegedly ""transferred and manipulated the body from the scene of the killing.""
> 
> The event marks a milestone in Mexico, considered the second country in Latin America with the most violence due to homophobia and transphobia, after Brazil, according to the National Observatory of LGBT Hate Crimes of the Rainbow Foundation.

> Jaqueline Fyoruti, a 46 year old [trans woman], was murdered with several knife blows this Friday night (08) in the Interlagos neighborhood in Três Lagoas. The victim was killed inside a room of the house where she lived. Jaqueline was stabbed several times by the killer. 
>
> According to friends of the victim, the author of the crime, a man, had probably returned to the scene and entered into a dispute with her. The floor of the room where Jaqueline was killed was covered in blood, indicating that she tried to defend herself before being murdered. The evidence suggests that she was the victim of robbery (robbery followed by death), reacting to the assault, where she was stabbed. The suspect dropped a wallet containing personal documents, which will be used to capture him by the Police.
> 
> According to family members, due to the level of violence Jaqueline's body, which had its neck and part of its head cut off, will be laid to rest in a sealed coffin. The crime is now being investigated by the authorities.
>
> Jaqueline would have been 50 years old on the 28th of December.

>
> Mitchell faces charges of murder, abuse of corpse, tampering with evidence, and related crimes. Assistant District Attorney Joanne Pescatore said the motive for the crime was unclear. Jackson may have survived, she said, if he had received medical attention sooner.

> A 22-year-old trans woman, whose social name has not been released, died hours after being stabbed this Thursday (15). The crime took place on Avenida Marechal Deodoro, in Jardim Leblon, and the main suspect is the victim's partner. He is being sought by the police.
> 
> According to the incident report, a PM (Military Police) team was called by witnesses and when they arrived at the scene, the victim was being rescued by a team from the Fire Department. She was unconscious and the military was trying to resuscitate her.
> 
> At the scene, witnesses said that the perpetrator of the stabbing would be a partner of the woman, but they were unable to report the dynamics of the crime. However, they said that the suspect was wearing a white T-shirt and brown shorts and that, after injuring the victim, he threw the used weapon in the flowerbed in front of the gas station, but the object was not found.
> 
> The victim had a perforated lung and was taken to Santa Casa de Campo Grande in serious condition at around 7:30 am on Thursday. She was not identified at the scene, as she was not carrying identifying documenta. Around 5 pm, a man looked for the 6th Civil Police Station and introduced himself as her father.
> 
> To the police, he reported that he learned from a person known to the victim that he had been stabbed. He then went to the hospital and recognized his daughter, who couldn't resist her injuries and died around 9 am. The suspect for the crime is still being sought. The case was registered as a qualified homicide by treason.

She was last seen alive four days earlier.

> The body of a 42-year-old trans woman was found this Friday morning inside an apartment located in the heart of the city of La Plata. According to the first information, the main hypothesis points to a homicide. The victim had a belt around her neck .
> 
> The case came to light earlier when a friend of the victim, who was identified by the police as Ariana Díaz Chávez, approached the address on Calle 7 between 58 and 59 during the early morning, after several days without being able to make contact with her.
> 
> Apparently, the witness had the key to the apartment and when she entered she found her friend's body in her room, lying face up on the floor and with a belt around her neck. Several bloodstains around her completed the scene, although she did not notice any signs of disorder or forced access. There was also nothing missing to indicate that she had been the victim of a robbery.
> 
> The woman immediately called 911 and minutes later the area was filled with personnel from the Ninth Police Station, the Homicide Cabinet of the DDI of La Plata, the Scientific Police and the SAME to carry out the corresponding expertise on the spot.
> 
> Diaz Chávez was 42 years old, a Peruvian national and, based on the first testimonies, she was a sex worker in the city of Las Diagonales. While the results of the forensic work are awaited, she revealed that when she was found she had been dead for at least four days .
> 
> Although all the indications so far point to a transfemicide, in principle the case was classified as ""investigation of the causes of death"" and is being investigated by UFI No. 8 from La Plata.

> LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — A Kentucky state senator said Tuesday that her transgender son, a trans rights advocate on whom “a lack of acceptance took a toll,” has died by suicide. He was 24.
> 
> Democratic Sen. Karen Berg said her son Henry Berg-Brousseau “long struggled with mental illness, not because he was trans but born from his difficulty finding acceptance.” She said he died on Friday.
> 
> The Louisville lawmaker said her son had just received a big promotion working for the Human Rights Campaign, which advocates for LGBTQ rights. He had finally found a community, she said, “but that could not undo the brokenness that he already felt.”
> 
> Berg has talked about her son during legislative proceedings as she opposed Kentucky bills that take aim at transgender people, which have increasingly passed in Republican statehouses across the country. That includes a 2022 law that bars transgender girls and women from participating in school sports matching their gender identity from sixth grade through college.
> 
> “On a daily basis at his job Henry would be aware of the hateful and vile anti-trans messaging being circulated around this country and focused at his workplace,” Berg said in a news release. “This hate building across the country weighed on him. In one of our last conversations he wondered if he was safe walking down the street.”

A seriously injured man was also found in the vehicle. He later died from his injuries.

> Last week, 27-year-old Caelee Love-Light was found dead at the scene of a car incident in Phoenix, Arizona. The Latina transwoman succumbed to gunshot injuries she sustained while involved in some sort of altercation with the male occupant of the car. He was stabbed several times and later died of his injuries at a nearby hospital.
> 
> Officers had responded to the area of 23rd Avenue and Baseline Road early Saturday morning at around 3:25 a.m. to an “unknown trouble call”, according to the original statement.
> 
> Upon arrival, officers were directed to a car where they found a man with serious injuries as well as an unresponsive woman inside. The woman, now identified as 27-year-old Caelee Lovelight, was pronounced dead at the scene. The man, now identified as 47-year-old Javin Casillias, was transported to a local hospital where he was later pronounced dead.
> 
> Detectives believe that Lovelight and Casillias were in a physical altercation with each other where Lovelight was shot and Casillias was stabbed, according to a police statement.
> 
> Sadly, mainstream media has focused on the “gun and knife battle” element of the story rather than the lives of the people who died. We don’t know what happened in that car, but given what we know generally and what I’ve learned from Caelee’s friends, it is likely that she was defending herself. It is certainly a possibility, but I guess the headline is too seductive when reporting on yet another seeming interpersonal violence incident. We don’t know why they were in the car together, the nature of their association, or who did what. If there is any evidence from inside the car like a dash cam or footage on a cell phone, that’s not been made public. Will there even be an investigation?
> 
> According to her friends, Caelee was born on May 17, 1995 in Texas. Her father was of Mexican descent and her mother was white. Caelee identified as Latina. She relocated to Portland where she legally changed her name and gender markers with the financial support of friends who understood how vital that process was to her welfare. It is unclear when she relocated again to Phoenix, Arizona. Her friends do not believe her remaining biological family will acknowledge her identity; her parents are both deceased, they report. So it is unclear what if any final arrangements will be made for Caelee. Will anyone in Phoenix organize a candlelight vigil? Will anyone locally reach out to her friends in Phoenix and learn more about her most recent lived experiences?
> 
> Caelee also used the names ‘Baby Goddess’ and ‘Candy Geisha’ on social media. I don’t know why, but I’m sharing that information to help her friends who may not know of her passing find this post.

According to her friends, Caelee was alienated (and afraid of) her birth family. Although her parents are no longer alive her friends were afraid that if her birth family claimed her body, they would deadname and misgender her - or (as happened to, among others, [Daine Grey](https://tdor.translivesmatter.info/reports/2018/07/02/daine-grey_san-francisco-california-usa_f7e5acc8)) refuse to claim her body at all.

> We’d like to thank Dave and Kimi Martin for graciously sharing the precious life and story of their child, Levi, with us this week. Levi would have turned 18 this last Sunday, March 19th. 
> (Trigger-warning: suicide)
>
> Levi is our intersex, transgender, gay son who was assigned female at birth. While he was raised as a girl, we didn't know that his DNA was male. He had a condition called Swyer's Syndrome.
>
> Levi's death by suicide had many reasons - a major one was his terror over how society treated transgender people. The recent actions of several states to ban transgender care for minors validates the fear he felt. Unless you have proximity, you have no understanding of how awful these bans are and how many precious lives will be lost.
>
> Kimi and I share Levi's story, (he was too afraid to come out in his mortal life), in the hope that those without proximity to transgender people might gain understanding, and thus, compassion. Our call as humans is to learn to love better, not judge better.
>
> Here is Levi’s story as given in his eulogy:
>
> I want to tell you a story. A love story. And nothing to do with a Taylor Swift song about Romeo and Juliet, but about our son Levi. Like any good love story, it begins with love and in the middle, there is difficulty, hard times, and even tragedy. But like any good love story, it ends in love. With a love that doesn’t end but keeps growing and moving forward.
>
> We hoped we were done after six kids. We were pretty sure. Not totally sure. Surely God would agree that six completed our family. We were tired, busy, and old (in our 40’s). However, the thought our family was not complete was constant, even though Kimi did her best to ignore it. We had to pray about it. And we did. And then we weren’t sure.  So we decided to move forward with faith.
>
> Well into Kimi’s pregnancy, we had a very bad week and all got sick. Following the admonition of James, we sent for the elders, in this case our friend, Quinn Millington. to receive a blessing by the laying on of hands. He gave each family member a blessing. Then he began to bless Dave, and part way through the blessing, he fell silent, a silence that went on and on.  When he concluded the blessing, he explained that he had been overcome by a feeling, that it was almost like a massive wall or building that descended on him, that it was so large he couldn’t put it into words for a long, long time.
>
> Quinn shared with us what he could at that time, and recently shared even more. He said, “There was a sense of deep gratitude and love that burned in my heart. I believe the Lord wanted to express His deep trust, gratitude and love for you and Kimi for your willingness to bring another of his precious children to earth. I also believe he wanted you to know of his deep love for Levi.”
>
> On March 19, 2005, in Montgomery, Alabama, this child was born. We named the child Emma. Because we didn’t know. Our son Garrett had older sisters and one younger sister, and he desperately wanted a brother. He and our newest bonded quickly.
>
> The child was different from the first day. Most babies are loose, relaxed, uncoordinated, and need a lot of support. This baby was tense and triggered by stimuli. As early as the second day of life, he could tense up so thoroughly that holding him was like holding a stiff board. He showed early signs of anxiety, even as a newborn. If Kimi held him facing out while walking down the stairs, his little body would tense up until his arms were raised above his head.
>
> He was so loved. His siblings fought over who got to hold him. We weren’t sure he would ever learn to walk.
>
> When Levi was eighteen months, we moved to Massachusetts. Our surroundings are information, and too much happens in them for us to take it all in. But this child seemed to take in far more than average. He would not wear jeans nor new clothes—everything had to be used, broken in, smooth. We later learned that one of Levi’s challenges was Sensory Modulation Disorder which basically means a condition in which non-painful stimuli such as types of touch or certain sounds or volume are perceived as abnormally irritating, unpleasant, or even painful.
>
> We lived in a house with an in-ground pool, and he loved the pool, loved swimming, loved the feel of cool water against hot skin on a steamy summer day. He wrote these words at age 13: “Swimming, to me, is very peaceful. When you go fully submerged underwater, you feel warm and comforted from all the pressure around you. Most of the time it is very quiet underwater, if not completely silent, and you can make sounds that nobody can hear. Because I love music so much, I sing songs and vocalize songs from shows and movies and games. Whenever I get out of the pool, all that I want to do is go back into the peaceful water. It is almost like nothing exists.” As he grew older and his body began to change, he did not like swimming in front of other people—he was self-conscious and felt the eyes of other people on him.
>
> He learned to read at a young age—not sight words and picture books. Kimi recognized that he was ready, she had taught his siblings to read, but with Levi’s independent nature, he didn’t want any help. She set him up on a computer program and he was reading within a matter of hours, prior to starting kindergarten. He learned to read deeply, and it became critical to how he processed the world. In fourth grade, he read Huckleberry Finn. In Sunday School, his teachers gave each child chances to read. He grew impatient with those who could not read big words, struggled to sound out words, measured their words awkwardly. His mind raced and chased ideas in circles and spirals. We could not name a topic on which he hadn’t researched and for which he had no opinion.
>
> He took piano lessons from various teachers, and he gained a sound early mastery, but he came to hate performing. In time, he asked to be able to stop taking lessons even though he loved to play. His social anxiety made them too difficult. When he gave up piano lessons, he continued to teach himself piano on his own. Sometimes, we would leave the house and come back to find him playing beautifully on his own. We hated to announce our presence because he would stop—he did not perform.
>
> Yet, for all his reluctance to perform and to be seen, in school and elsewhere, he was a constant chatterbox, and one with no filter. The words he inhaled from reading books and articles online had to find their outlet, and he spoke them without regard to the audience. In school, he talked constantly to whoever was seated next to him, and frequently, the two of them got into trouble. Further, even at the earliest ages, he challenged everyone on everything if he was convinced he was right. He pushed teachers with incisive questions, argued with points he believed to be false, almost never backed down.
>
> In third and fourth grades, it was too much, and we home schooled him. Academically, he soared, and he was relieved without the social strain, but keeping pace with him and giving him social opportunities to develop generated new challenges in the family, and eventually, he returned to public school. Whether at home or at school, his grades were impeccable: straight A’s. But socially, everything was a strain. His constant chattering ultimately led to people shutting him down and out. It hurt, and he withdrew and became more suspicious of people.
>
> And then, seventh grade.
>
> We did not know, and we could not see the big picture. When you live with someone, changes creep up on you, and you amalgamate them into your understanding of a person without necessarily seeing how dramatically something has shifted. In seventh grade, he began to struggle to complete homework. He appeared uninterested and unmotivated even though the work was intellectually easy for him. One would not think that B’s would signify much—they typically don’t. But what did was the apparent lack of effort, the tendency to have assignments slide by with no recognition that finishing them was important.
>
> What do we think now? Based on what we now know, what should be happening in puberty was not, and the disconnects in identity were probably starting to create foundational strains.
>
> In Church, he remained talkative and challenging. One of his Sunday School teachers described him as “savagely smart” and “the smartest kid I’ve ever taught” (to the chagrin of his siblings whom this teacher also taught). This teacher emphasized that students must try to stay ahead of him, and he sometimes sent home subjects to research. He needn’t have bothered—our child had been researching everything all along, and Levi didn’t bother with these.
>
> In eighth grade, we were finally able to find him a therapist. After a few months, the therapist indicated that he might be a threat to himself. We had him admitted to a psychiatric hospital, and he enjoyed it—played Phase 10, talked openly, did outdoor activities. He came home with a series of medical appointments and diagnoses. He was ADHD, prone to severe depression and anxiety, capable of dissociation. He went back to school, took on medicine and therapies and disliked all of it. He spent much of his time in the counselor's office, completing school work there. Kimi also spent a lot of time there, working with the counselor to determine which classes could be dropped, and which needed to be continued to avoid a failing grade.
>
> He was convinced he would die young. He read up on all his diagnoses and added his own—he became convinced he was on the autism spectrum. Later, another doctor would diagnose him with borderline personality disorder.
>
> One day, a friend’s mother called to tell us that he had been cutting and had drunk a small amount of nail polish remover. We explained to him that he had to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital again. This time, the experience was a slog in a drab building with lots of boredom.
>
> No, he told them, he wasn’t suicidal. Yes, the program was helping. No, he was not a threat to himself. No, he would never cut again. Yes, he would seek out therapy and ask for help and take his medicine and talk to his parents and do stress relief and exercise and meditate and journal and relax. Could he go home now and not come back? Of course.
>
> His ninth-grade year started out well. Because of his poor grades in the spring, the school wanted to lower the rigor a bit, but he argued with the school to let him take honors classes, showing that he was impossibly bored in standard classes, and that he could manage honors classes. He wanted to handle it himself, seeking out the guidance counselor without letting Kimi know what he was doing. He had to argue hard and long for honors classes. He prevailed. And then, he didn’t or couldn’t keep pace. We did not understand. We wondered if it was lack of willpower, failure to manage mental illness, lack of desire. Meanwhile, his ever-bright brain burned hot, and he researched and researched, endlessly chasing ideas. There were no definitive answers to the questions he asked because there were always more questions beyond them.
>
> When he was in tenth grade and just as the pandemic was developing, a friend of ours had a son come out publicly as gay. This friend stepped away from Church leadership positions. On Sunday one day, this friend went to the pulpit and gave his witness of the love of God and the need to love all our brothers and sisters. He affirmed the dignity of LGBTQ+ people. As our friend walked away from the pulpit, our youngest looked at him with a huge smile and made two huge thumbs up. We should have known something. But changes creep on us. We fail to connect details to the narratives of our lives. Or we shape the details to fit the narrative we have formed.
>
> “Emma” should have started having her period but hadn’t. So doctors resorted to hormone therapy to help trigger them. Sure enough, we found our youngest wasn’t taking the medicine. Kimi challenged him and insisted that the medicines had to be taken because failure to do so could be dangerous. The performative non-performer looked at Kimi and said, “Well, the thing is, ha ha, I’m trans.” Kimi was unmoved. “Throwing something like that at me isn’t going to change the fact that you have to take the medicine.” This time he was more serious, “Mom, really, I’m trans.”
>
> Kimi accepted him. He didn’t want Dave to know. Dave had been a Latter-day Saint bishop and a member of stake presidencies. He followed rules and obeyed Church authority.
>
> Dave proved to be surprising. He accepted our youngest as he was, and he began to read and research. He was a Sunday School teacher, and soon he was giving lessons on what the Bible had to say about helping the marginalized.
>
> A few months later, when developmental changes were still not happening, our youngest underwent a battery of tests, and soon, much greater information emerged. Through genetic testing, we gained an understanding we never had.
>
> All of us are both profoundly similar to each other and all of life, and yet, we are also completely unique. This is a duality, and dualities exist everywhere.
>
> Our youngest had Swyer Syndrome. Swyer Syndrome describes a series of genetic mutations that cause an individual to express female anatomy, while the person is genetically male. In other words, our youngest had all the body parts associated with females except he wasn’t female.  He had XY chromosomes—if he were to die and have to be identified via DNA, a medical examiner would say he was male. In our youngest’s case, he was his own special brand of unique: doctors at Boston Children’s Hospital had never seen his particular mutation in the portfolio of Swyer cases they had dealt with. Ours was literally a sample size of 1.
>
> Levi reacted by doing what he always did—he researched. In short order, he was more expert on intersex conditions than most medical professionals. Doctors would begin to discuss something with him at a simpler level, then say, “Wait. I forget that you are you,” and they would switch and begin to speak with him as a peer, as if he were a medical resident.
>
> DNA is what makes us both unique and similar. It should not be a surprise that it is a duality of sorts, itself. In 1953, Dr. James Watson struggled to understand DNA’s shape until he had a dream in which he saw intertwining snakes with heads at opposite ends (other accounts indicate he also saw a double-sided staircase).
>
> We asked our youngest how he identified himself, and he said that he was “intersex, leaning toward male, and gay.” We asked what name he should go by, and he originally selected “Twine.” We didn’t understand and thought it a curious choice. He never explained, and in short order, he came to dislike the name and would eventually discard it. Intersex individuals with Swyer often select the direction they wish to go, and many choose to honor the anatomical presentation and proceed with female-related hormone therapy. Our youngest did not feel female and did not believe he had ever been meant to be female. He began early steps toward transition.
>
> We asked if he might wish to cut his hair, and he declined. We asked if he might wish to discard his dresses, and he said, “No, I might still wear them.” The duality was powerful and also almost entirely misunderstood by everyone.
>
> When we are born, we begin to die. And most faiths view death as a birth into a new life. These, too, are dualities. When we felt that there must be another child, we accepted, as well, that we were birthing a child into both life and death.
>
> On Sunday, December 18, 2022, we had finished preparing dinner and we called to our youngest, our only child at home. No response. Dave went to the basement. The door was closed tightly, and a note had been placed there. It began, “Don’t open Door. Call Police.” It was a small act of grace that preceded the pouring out of the years of pain and fears that he had experienced. He apologized and expressed his love. He feared turning eighteen and trying to navigate as an adult. He explained that he could not get himself to do anything and couldn’t see being able to do so. He couldn’t live as a woman but be a man; he couldn’t bear to come out even to some family members, though he knew he was loved. In his words, “I … can’t take living like a girl, being the way I am, yet I am too much of a coward to come out to my siblings, or to do anything to make my body match my mind more. I am terrified of how society treats transgender persons.” He made clear that the decision was his and no one was at fault; he indicated that the media and what he read or saw should not be blamed. His final sentences state that “This is not the fault of any of you. My brain is just faulty. I’m excited to finally be free.”
>
> Ultimately, he signed his letter. His signature is clear, certain, and confident. For it, he used a name he had recently come up with and had asked his parents to use. Its origins are Hebrew, and in the same way that twine’s first dictionary definition is “a strong string of two or more strands twisted together,” his new name means, “united, joined, adhered to, joined together, or joined in harmony.”
>
> We don’t know if he chose it deliberately, but Levi is the perfect name.
>
> We are here today to celebrate the life of Levi. He was spunky, sassy, feisty, and confident, until he wasn’t. He was funny, intelligent, quirky, argumentative, loving, stubborn, and kind, always.
>
> We are here to mourn Levi. This is a tremendous loss in so many ways, not just for our family or for all those who knew him, but for the world. He had so much potential. His future contributions, whatever they would have been, are lost to us now.
>
> We are here to acknowledge Levi’s pain. Being transgender in this world was too heavy a burden for him to bear. He suffered tremendously until he just couldn’t suffer any longer. We like to think of him as happy now, something that we haven’t seen in a very long time.

The police were summoned to the Hospital São Vicente de Paulo, where a patient who was the victim of physical aggression was admitted. At the scene, the doctor told the PMs that Samu's ambulance sent the 27-year-old [trans woman] for medical attention, and she couldn't resist her injuries and died. The doctor also said that, later, a friend of the victim arrived at the hospital, informing that they worked together and that the victim had been attacked by another [trans woman].

> The witness was located by the police and confirmed who was the author of the homicide, passing on her possible whereabouts. During patrolling, the PMs found the 25-year-old suspect, who confessed that they had assaulted the victim, saying that they already had an old feud and that, according to her, the victim would have said that they were going to kill her and that yesterday they went to “collect the tape"".
> 
> The suspect received a voice in prison and was sent to the 14th SDP. The body of the fatal victim was collected from the Legal Medical Institute (IML) of Guarapuava.

> Last Saturday, December 24, the body of a woman was found in the waters of the Ría de Bilbao. She was carrying two two-kilo weights, each tied to her body from her so that she remained submerged under the river.
> 
> At dawn on Christmas Eve, the emergency department received a notice from a citizen. He claimed to have seen the body of a person in the estuary. The victim was found near the Hanging Bridge, in Portugalete. An Ertzaintza patrol, from the Getxo police station, went to the scene. Once there, a Red Cross boat came to remove the lifeless body from the water. The body was placed on the Las Arenas pier, on a stretcher.
> 
> According to the Diario Vasco, it has been confirmed that the victim is a 40-year-old transsexual woman. She has a fair complexion, short brown hair and a tall stature. At the time she was found she was dressed in a puffer coat, jeans and designer boots. Despite the fact that the woman did not carry any documentation with her, the investigators could have already detected her identity. In the same way, the necro-review has been carried out, which is the identification procedure through the victim's fingerprints.
> 
> At first it was suspected that the event could be a suicide. However, after investigations by the Judicial Police of the Civil Guard and the Ertzaintza, it was declared that it was a homicide. 
> 
> The autopsy was performed at the Bilbao Legal Medicine Institute. Once carried out, it was possible to know that the victim, prior to being thrown into the water, was suffocated.
>
> Furthermore, no water was found in her lungs. Therefore, this fact would confirm that she was ifeless when she fell into the estuary and did not die from drowning. The person who threw the woman into the water attached the weights to the victim to cover her up. The culprit taped the weights to the body - presumably to hide any trace of evidence. The lifeless body of the woman remained submerged for four to five days in the water.

> The trans woman who was found on Saturday morning with serious injuries, and who until noon yesterday was in intensive care at the Hospital Escuela de la Corrientes, died yesterday. Patricia Ramírez, 41, was being searched for since Friday night by her friends and family. On Saturday she was found in the 17 de Agosto neighborhood of the city of Corrientes, with multiple injuries resulting from an alleged crash.
> 
> “The loss is irreparable. Patricia was an activist for trans rights and the job quota. She was a companera, highly educated, a partner and a Peronist. She was essential, ”said Teresita Paz, a Corrientes activist and friend of Patricia, in dialogue with the DIARIO de la Región .
> 
> Paz, like different organizations and movements of the diverse community, held the State responsible for the death of Ramírez, who did not have a stable job in a province that still does not adhere to the national labor quota law for travesti, transsexual and transgender people. “ She was ultra-qualified to occupy any place in the State, but everything is late or not at all. Patricia died in the range of the age that trans women die, she died at 41 years old, ”she asserted.
> 
> “It is the responsibility of the State because the trans labor quota does not apply. If there is a trans labor quota, the compañeras will not be practicing sexual slavery. The national, provincial, and municipal governments are responsible,"" he said, recalling that the national law establishes a quota of 1% that the ""highest percentage stays in Buenos Aires and is not met here.""
> 
> Regarding what happened in the early hours of Saturday, Paz said that Patricia was accompanied by a “person who was riding a motorcycle, when a car appeared and ran over the two of them. Her companion got scared and left. It happened at 4:30, because of the noise there are neighbors who came out and behaved very well, one of the neighbors who came out with his wife is a doctor. She wants to get up, she gives her name, last name and her ID, and she faints there to never wake up again.
