> HRC is deeply saddened to learn of the death of Aaron Lynch, a 26-year-old transgender man who was shot and killed by police in McClean, Virginia on July 7. Aaron’s death is at least the 26th violent killing of a transgender or gender non-conforming person in 2022. We say “at least” because too often these deaths go unreported — or misreported.
> 
> At 26, Aaron had his whole life in front of him. My thoughts and prayers are with Aaron’s loved ones. Aaron’s death is a tragic result of our system’s ineffectiveness in caring for people who are struggling mentally and emotionally. People, especially those of multiple marginalized identities, suffer every day as a result. His life did not have to end like this. We demand more focus and funding on mental health care in our country, including the addition of mental health counselors to respond to certain critical situations. No family should have to bear this pain.""
> 
> On July 7, police responded to a call made by a friend who was concerned about Aaron’s wellbeing and went to his home to check in on him. It was reported that police arrived with a trained mental health co-responder but Aaron was not found on the property. Police then returned a second time without the co-responder. After a back-and-forth with police, officers attempted to tase Aaron unsuccessfully. One officer then fired his weapon, shooting Aaron four times. No officers were injured and Aaron was pronounced dead at the scene. The shooting is under investigation and all involved officers have been placed on restricted duty.
> 
> Aaron’s family released the following statement to local press:
> 
> “Our son, Aaron, was experiencing a severe mental health crisis on July 7. He was scared and asked for both of the 911 calls that were made that day. We believe that the three police officers who answered the second 911 call could have, and should have, handled this far differently. To respond to Aaron’s mental health crisis by shooting him at all, let alone multiple times, cannot be justified. We recognize that, at times, police officers face grave and unknown dangers in the line of duty, but that was not the case for that call at our home regarding our son. Aaron was about 5’ 6"", slightly built, and holding just a bottle and a decorative mask. As parents, we mourn the heartbreaking loss of our son and are left with only memories and regret. Had we known there was any possibility that the police responding to the second 911 call would use lethal force against Aaron during a mental health crisis, we would not have involved them until a mental health counselor could be present, as was the case for the response to the first 911 call. We hope our efforts to find out more about this incident will, in the future, help families in similar situations avoid such a tragic outcome.”

> A second local man, 32, initially detained together with Lukin, was later freed; evidence collected thus far proved that while the two men had been spotted by cameras moving around together, the second man had not committed the murder, explained Kelly Kruusimägi, senior prosecutor at the Northern District Prosecutor's Office Department for Drug-related, Grave and Organized Crimes.
> 
> Anette Maletjärv, cooperation officer at the Estonian LGBT Association, tweeted about Houston's murder on Monday, sharing screenshots of the public message posted by Houston's cousin Aryelle Freeman Hopelezz confirming the victim's identity as well as expressing their dismay that the Estonian media had misgendered Houston in earlier coverage.
> 
> ""On July 9, a young Black trans woman was murdered in Tallinn,"" Maletjärv wrote in Estonian. ""This is a terribly tragedy and I am in shock. I haven't heard of a single case of an LGBT person being killed in Estonia before. The murder victim's gender identity has not been reported correctly in the media.""
> 
> Police were notified at midday on Saturday, July 9 that a body bearing signs of violence had been found in a rental apartment in Tallinn's Old Town; Lukin and the second man were detained in connection with the murder around 1:30 p.m. the next day.  According to the allegations, Lukin repeatedly stabbed Houston, a casual acquaintance, in the apartment that same morning.

Taylor,,,2022_07_09_Taylor.jpg,https://www.thecanary.co/feature/2022/07/18/a-trans-prisoner-took-his-own-life-his-loved-ones-say-the-prison-service-is-responsible/,9-Jul-2022,,HMP Eastwood Park,Falfield,Wotton-under-Edge,Gloucestershire,United Kingdom,51.6350504,-2.4705717,custodial,suicide,"Taylor died by suicide in a women's prison on Saturday 9th July - the day of London's Trans Pride.

He was serving an indeterminate prison sentence and had already been in prison for 14 years of what was originally a 4 year sentence.

While in prison, he had been subjected to repeated institutional transphobia.

> On Saturday 9 July – the day of London’s Trans Pride – a trans man named Taylor took his own life at HMP Eastwood Park in Gloucestershire.
> 
> Taylor slit his own throat to put an end to an indeterminate prison sentence that had already lasted over 14 years. He was one of the thousands of people still suffering in UK prisons after being given an Indeterminate sentence for Public Protection (IPP). Sadly, Taylor is reportedly the second prisoner to take their own life at Eastwood Park in recent weeks. At least 242 IPP prisoners have died in prison, with at least 72 of them (including Taylor) taking their own lives.
> 
> On the evening of 10 July, an angry protest took place outside HMP Eastwood Park. Demonstrators accused the prison of being responsible for Taylor’s death. Loved ones gave speeches outside, and prisoners inside the walls joined in with the chants. One eyewitness said that at one point it seemed like the whole prison was chanting Taylor’s name in unison with the demonstration outside. A statement and call to action written by his close friends claims that, in the months running up to his death, prison officers had beaten Taylor and punished him for kissing another prisoner.
> 
> During Taylor’s time in prison, his friends said he had received transphobic abuse from both prisoners and officers. They also said that one officer had deliberately and persistently “deadnamed” Taylor. Moreover, his intimate relationships with women prisoners had been pathologised and discouraged. And he had been deliberately separated from the people that he loved.
> 
> The authors of the statement spoke about who Taylor was and what he had been through:
> 
> ""Taylor was a trans prisoner trapped in the UK prison system for over 14 years. He was an IPP prisoner, who had served 10 years longer in prison than his original sentence. He was a beloved friend to anarchist comrades who met him in prison. He had ACAB [all cops are bastards] on his knuckles and an anti-authoritarian spirit and a deep love for animals. He was a working class ‘old school’ prisoner who knew which side he was on. He hated the system with every ounce of his being.""
> 
> Taylor’s friends spoke about his organising inside prison with the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) and against cruel IPP sentences like the one he was serving:
> 
> Taylor was one of the first prisoner members of the IWW via the Incarcerated Workers Organising Committee (IWOC) that was founded in England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland in 2015. He was also active with Smash IPP, contributing to the newsletter and encouraging other IPP prisoners to join the group.
> 
> IPP prisoners are given a ‘tariff’ for the crime they’re being sentenced for, but once that tariff is served they are not automatically released. Their freedom is in the hands of the parole board. This makes IPP sentences equivalent to a life sentence, but they have largely been handed out for minor crimes.
> 
> Taylor’s friends call the IPP sentence a death sentence:
> 
> ""It is effectively a life sentence for minor crimes. After huge public pressure, IPP sentences were abolished in 2012, but not retrospectively, which means there are still more than 3500 people in prison with no release date. The uncertainty is a living hell. This sentence led to the UK having one of the highest rates of prisoner suicide in the world. ""
>
> One contributor to a recent documentary about IPP prisoners, called Unintended Consequences, said:
> 
> ""the miserable reality of people on IPP sentences is there’s a very good chance that they will kill themselves. If you’re a prisoner you’re twice as likely to kill yourself as a member of the general population. If you’re an IPP prisoner you’re twice again as likely to kill yourself.""
>
> For Taylor, the IPP was a death sentence. He was given 4 years for burglary but served 14 years before he died. The long-term imprisonment with no end-date totally destroyed Taylor’s mental health. He attempted suicide multiple times, including slitting his own throat and taking an overdose that led him to being in a coma twice. It eventually killed him.
> 
> In order to secure his release, Taylor had to try and satisfy the parole board. When he failed to do that, his mental health spiralled downwards. And his increasing distress was weaponised against him to keep him locked up. According to Taylor’s friends:
> 
> ""At each board hearing, new ‘hoops’ can be created that the prisoner will need to then jump through. For example, a prisoner might do everything the Parole Board directs and then two years later at the next hearing, the Parole Board might say “you still need to address X behaviour and therefore do X course.” This leads to a continual process of imprisonment where goal posts are repeatedly moved. The uncertainty, frustration and lack of power leads to prisoner behaviour deteriorating, whether that is increased drug use, self-harm or kicking off in protest.""
> 
> This behaviour then becomes the justification for their continuing imprisonment, because that person is not ‘safe’ for the community or has not ‘addressed their offending behaviour’. The cycle continues.
> 
> Taylor’s friends describe the events that led up to his IPP sentence:
> 
> The combination of childhood abuse and gender dysphoria led to drug and alcohol abuse, as well as a long-term pattern of self-harm. Taylor became an addict, and as a working class person with no financial means, “crime” was the only option to sustain his habit. This led Taylor to a very self-destructive life, including many abusive relationships and actions that he deeply regretted. Taylor accessed many mental health services, however, none of them affirmed Taylor’s gender identity or needs and he was repeatedly pathologised, hospitalised and imprisoned.
> 
> In the judges’ summing up of his case whereby he was given an IPP sentence, he recognised it was Taylor’s ‘gender issues’ that led to his imprisonment.

However, witnesses dispute this and described the way she was killed in an execution.

> 
> What they did was cowardice. I don't know who it was but Jesus knows. Justice will be done here on Earth and in the heaven. She was sick and needed help and not violence. She needed psychological care. I even thought about a judge to compulsorily commit her. I have her psychiatrist's reports. They said that drug use was making her schizophrenic. It was supposed to put her in a recovery clinic,"" she said.
>
> Silvania said that Lara was her only child. Regarding the PM's version, that her daughter had attacked military police officers, Silvania said that she was never aggressive and that there were other ways to contain her .
> 
> ""She loved me. A wonderful heart. They were strong, there were many. Why didn't they do the same as they did when they went inside my house to commit her? They could have done the same. They went with a shield, a non-lethal weapon. Why didn't they act that way too? Why didn't they contact me? Why didn't they let the judge know? She was in need of help. She didn't need to lose her life”, said the mother.
>
> Residents who talked to the reporters contested the PM's account . According to them, the woman did not attack the police and was executed during their approach.
> 
> According to one of the residents, who preferred not to identify himself, he said that Lara used to make jokes with the police when they approached someone in the neighborhood and that the police officers did not like it and had already threatened her .
> 
> ""The policeman arrived to approach. But it was not a common approach. Lara said something he didn't like. He got on top of her, punched her several times and shot her several times and she had no way to react. He killed her sitting down. She had no right idea. She was undergoing psychiatric treatment, took that lot of medicine. She was executed because she didn't have anything. They are abusing. Yesterday it was Lara and today it could be my son. I think there was a prejudice too"", reported.

> The case was registered on the duty of the Department of Homicide and Protection of the Person (DHPP) as death in confrontation with a state agent and is being investigated.

> Quindio: Last weekend a homicide took place in the Las Américas neighborhood of the city. The victim was identified as Ana Paula Alvino who was a member of the LGBTI community as a trans woman and received several stab wounds.
>
> Colonel Jorge Mauro Córdoba, commander of the Department Police, reported: ""Unfortunately we had a homicide with a sharp weapon inside a residence, there was a transgender person known by the name of Paula. The victim was dedicated to being a web cam model, that is what we have been able to advance initially in the investigation, but we establish all the activities to clarify the facts.”

A reward of 5 million pesos was subsequently offered for information leading to the conviction of her murderer, and in early November 2022 a 21-year-old suspect was arrested.

She was found dead on Sunday 17th July.

> Mexican musician and multi-disciplinary artist Valiz Ortíz was found dead on Sunday, July 17. She was 39 years old. The news broke on Monday afternoon (July 18) after close friends began sharing condolences messages on social media in an outpour of grief that has highlighted two decades of the artist’s visionary, influential, and extensive body of work.
> 
> Hailing from Monterrey, Nuevo León, Ortíz became closely associated with the city’s experimental indie boom of the late 2000s that saw the rise of her band Bam Bam, as well as Selma Oxor, White Ninja, NRMAL, and underground venue El Garage. Ortíz was a prolific singer/songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and producer, an authority in Mexican psych music with detours into ambient and noise, and her work extended far beyond Bam Bam into projects like Ruidos en el Techo, Hypnomango, and XYX. In 2017, she relocated to Mexico City and launched Manitas Nerviosas, a new project melding her psychedelic visions with DIY electronic textures.
> 
> Valis Ortíz was a proud trans woman, and Manitas Nerviosas became a canvas for her ongoing metamorphosis. “Tu Carita Toda Hermosa” captured an existential shift for the artist where she shed the pseudonym “Mou,” by which fans and colleagues had known her for many years. She later legally changed her name to Valis (Vast Active Living Intelligence System), inspired by Philip K. Dick’s 1981 novel of the same name. She frequently collaborated with fellow trans artists such as Alda Arita, Luisa Almaguer, and Sofia Moreno; the latter a co-director on her music video for “Pármenux” from her buoyant final album A Love Supermeme. She was also an outspoken critic of TERFs (Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminists), a stance she immortalized with devilish gusto on “[Terfs R’ Nazis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6GWxkFkWx8)”.
> 
> Beyond her own musical work, Ortíz was an active part of labels such as Nene Records and Oris Label.  She was also an architect and talented illustrator, releasing numerous zines and with much of her visual work still available on Tumblr. Humor, criticism, and raw honesty intersected across her work, making this an immeasurable loss for Mexican experimental music and underground art.

> 
> It’s believed that she and the female friend traveled together often but that’s really all we got from investigators and have no clue if the friend is CIS or Trans. They also noted that the region has been dealing with an outbreak of fatal shootings and suspicious deaths since April and the sheriff vowed “decisive” action including gang crackdowns, roadblock checkpoints and use of high-tech surveillance cameras in targeted areas.

Before she died she had rapidly lost 30kg in weight and was suffering froms of vision, vomiting, dizziness, episodes of very low blood pressure and fatigue.

> Sasha Barrionuevo was 38 years old, had 13 siblings and 35 nephews. As with many trans women, she found no other source of income than prostitution. For a long time she had to deal with police abuse on the streets of Mar del Plata. She spent the last year and a half of her life, imprisoned. She suffered and reported beatings. Her body gave multiple warning signs, but she was accused of making it up. She died in hospital, almost simultaneously with the signing of her release. The agony was the key to get out of confinement. To get rid of her, when it was too late.
>
> Sasha passed away on July 20 at the Dr. Oscar Alende Interzonal General Acute Hospital (Higa). She had been transferred there while she was detained in the 44th mayor of the Batán Prison Complex. She had lost more than 30 kilos in the last time, she was losing her vision and she had almost no mobility when they took her on a stretcher to receive extramural care. The Provincial Commission for Memory (CPM), which had been monitoring her situation, demands that the causes of her death and the incidence of lack of access to health care be investigated.
>
> “She told me that she felt very sick. She abruptly lost 35 kilos. She was vomiting, she had vision loss, she was disoriented. But she and her companions said that the Penitentiary Service did not believe her . Due to an underlying illness that she had, her immune system was compromised. She should have had tests done to rule out meningitis, tuberculosis, everything. Why didn't they take her to the hospital? They let her be. Her death could have been avoided, ”Yésica Gómez, one of Sasha's many nieces, is outraged. They were almost the same age and a very close bond: ""We grew up together.""
