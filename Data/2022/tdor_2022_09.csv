A suspect has been arrested.

> A community in Germany is mourning the death of a 25-year-old transgender man who died today after being attacked and seriously injured at the closing event as part of Christopher Street Day or LGBTQ+ Pride in Münster in northwest Germany several days ago.
>
> Residents of the progressive university city and political leaders are expressing disbelief and shock over the act of violence. The man was identified only by his first name, Malte.
> 
> As recently as Tuesday, the Trans*Inter*-Münster Association, to which Malte belonged, had announced that he remained in critical condition after being assaulted at the city's Pride celebration. On Friday, German police announced an arrest in the case, according to television station WDR.
> 
> Thousands gathered in the town's marketplace today to remember the young man many call a hero. ""The hostilities are increasing again,"" said Trans*Inter*-Münster association president Felix Adrian Schäper. He added that attacks against LGBTQ+ people are rising because more queer people live openly, radio station Antenne Münster reported.
> 
> The Christopher Street Day Münster association, which organizes Münster's LGBTQ+ Pride celebrations, released a statement following the attack. CSD Münster says Malte was attacked shortly after 8 p.m. on Saturday. According to witnesses, the assailant insulted several women at the festival, calling them ""lesbian whores"" and telling them to ""piss off.""
>
> Malte, police say, noticed the situation and asked the troublemaker to quit insulting people. Suddenly, the attacker punched Malte in the face, making him unsteady on his feet. Then, the person punched Malte in the face a second time, causing him to lose consciousness and hit the ground in an unprotected fall, hitting his head on the asphalt.
> 
> The suspect then fled on foot with along with another person. Eyewitnesses described the suspect as a man between 18 and 20 years old, five foot six to five foot nine inches tall, with a slim frame. He was wearing flared jeans, a t-shirt, and a bucket hat.
> 
> German police had launched a large-scale investigation and asked for the public to contact authorities with tips. Late on Friday word came that police arrested a 20-year-old suspect at the city's central train station. According to press reports, a German police official recognized the offender on closed circuit television. No further details about the suspect were released, in accordance with German privacy laws.
> 
> Supporters and mourners rallied in the central market square of the town on Friday evening. What was supposed to be a rally to draw attention to the attack instead became a rallying cry in the name of Malte.
> 
> In a call to action, CSD Münster took to Instagram. ""As a community, we stand together against queer hostility, any form of bigotry and violence,"" the organization wrote. ""Let's strengthen each other and always defend each other! But on Friday, it should be about taking our emotions to the public. How that affects us as people, and how our everyday life is changed by something like this.
> 
> ""It's already well known that after the CSD festival, a young transman was knocked unconscious because he tried stopping anti-queer remarks from being made,"" the series of images comprising the statement read.
> 
> ""The idea that someone from our community has to endure such violence near our safe spaces makes us sad and angry. We want to express these emotions in a rally on Friday at 6 p.m. in front of Prinzipalmarkt."" It concluded, ""Bring banners and posters.""
> 
> The event featured musical contributions and speeches and an open mic opportunity for people to share their emotions and feelings.

Football fans in Bremen expressed their sorrow over Malte's death:
 
> In the wake of a violent attack at a Münster pride event, the soccer community is adding their voices to the calls for action against homophobic and transphobic hate crimes in western Germany.
>
> Flanked by gay and trans pride flags, supporters groups and ultras of the Bundesliga team SV Werder Bremen — reportedly among them Caillera, Infamous Youth, and Endeavour 3000 — held up tifos during Friday’s match against FC Augsburg with messages including:
>
> “Queerphobia kills!” (“Queerfeindlichkeit tötet!)
>
> “Against all transphobia!” (“Gegen jede Transfeindlichkeit!”)
>
> “Rest in peace Malte”

> Ingram was kind and caring. He did his best to understand other's pain and help them. I went to multiple protests and marches with him. Where he stood in support of causes that sometimes didn't even affect him directly. He was always gentle and, as someone at his funeral said, I couldn't imagine anyone ever saying something bad about him. He loved animals and was a great dog parent. He also believed that if he put good into the world and always tried to minimise harm, he would go to heaven. I don't know about heaven or what happens after we die. But he definitely put good into the world. I feel immensely privileged to have known such a wonderful man, and to have him call me friend. He will be forever missed by everyone he knew.

> Luise Fernandes was transgender and had been living in São Luís for a year, where she was studying psychology at a private university in the capital of Maranhão. After her death, the family ended up burying the body of Devandro Lima, who died in a car accident, in her place. The error was only discovered five days after Devandro Lima's family found out about the accident and went to the Legal Medical Institute (IML).
> 
> Luise's family went to court to bury the young woman's body in Brasília, her homeland. But due to negative decisions, she was buried in São Luís.
> 
> The victim was found dead in a square in the Cidade Operária neighborhood where she lived on September 6. According to Sônia Fernandes Cazé, her daughter, who suffered from depression, resorted to suicide, through an overdose of medication.
> 
> Without money, the mother was not able to travel immediately for São Luís. The following day, Ms. Sônia went to Instituto Florescer, an organization that supports the LGBTQIA+ public, where Luise had already been treated because of her psychological disorders. Meanwhile, the young woman's body was taken to the Legal Medical Institute. Five days after supposedly burying her daughter, back in Brasília, the mother received a call from the Legal Medical Institute warning that the body she had buried was that of someone else.


In a cruel twist of fate, five days after burying her daughter in Brasília, Luise's mother received a call telling her that she had buried the wrong person. Although the body has been exhumed and returned to the correct family, the morgue are now refusing to release Luise's body.

> Five days after supposedly burying her daughter, back in Brasília, the mother received a call from the Legal Medical Institute warning that the body she had buried was that of someone else. The person who Sônia had buried was Devandro Lima Souza, as shown in the document sent to the cemetery, requesting the exhumation of the body to deliver to the family, who live in Santa Inês, in the interior of Maranhão. The information we have is that Devandro was the victim of a car accident days before Luise's death. The exchange of bodies was only discovered because his family went to the IML.
> 
> Devandro's body was exhumed on the 16th. Luise's remains in the cold chamber of the Legal Medical Institute. According to the lawyer Silas Pazzini, who defends the family, the IML refused to provide a document confirming the exchange of bodies. “The biggest difficulty we have at the moment is documentation. It is necessary that a correction be made in Luise's Death Certificate, to include the new burial place. The real place, because Luise was not buried, another body was buried”, explained the delegate. To be able to take the body to Brasília, the family will have to go to court. The Human Rights Commission of the Brazilian Bar Association in Maranhão (OAB-MA) is already on the case.
> 
> Dona Sônia just wants to take her daughter to be buried in the city where she was born and rest her heart.
> 
> “I don't want to know who is guilty, I want to solve my problem, take Luise to a dignified burial, that every human being has that right”, declared the young woman's mother.

Although he was supported by his parents, he had also suffered conflicts and bullying at school.

> “It’s a parent’s worst nightmare.” A mother from Gatineau is crying out from the heart so that no child ever again decides to take their own life because they question their sexual orientation or gender identity.
> 
> On March 9, Annick Dinelle’s life changed. Her child, who had asked to be called Alex, rather than [deadname], committed suicide. Alex’s questions about his gender identity and sexual orientation had begun in the months leading up to his death, his mother claims.
>
> “[He] had asked us if we would accept that she was gay, lesbian or trans. [He] was looking at [himself] a lot. As his parents, he had been told that no matter [how he identified] we were always going to love him”. The child had expressed her wish to wear a [binder] around [his] chest to hide [his] curves and even to have [his] breasts completely removed. For Christmas, he also wanted to receive boxers for boys as a present.
> 
> In the fall, Alex’s parents noticed a change of attitude in their child, who showed more and more aggressive behavior, which was not like him. The mother claims her child was allegedly bullied at school. To help Alex, his parents made an appointment with a doctor, in addition to consulting social workers. Just before spring break, an intervention plan was put in place to support Alex. But that was not enough: the Wednesday following the return to class, Alex ended his life.

A coroner observed that Alex had developed precocious puberty and was struggling with the changes happening to his body.

Daniel Silvestrilli, 30, has been charged with her murder.

> Buenos Aires, Argentina. The travesti and trans community of La Plata is shocked by the transvesticide of Nicol Ruiz, a 35-year-old woman and mother of two children, who was savagely beaten on the head by her sister's partner. 
> 
> The attack that led to her death was perpetrated on the night of Friday, September 23, at her sister's house. When Nicol arrived at the house, located between calles 141 and 79 in the Los Hornos neighborhood of La Plata, she found her sister arguing strongly with her partner, Daniel Silvestrilli.
> 
> Nicol intervened to stop the man's violence, but the aggressor reacted against her,  hitting her hard with a broomstick on the head until Nicol collapsed unconscious. Although she was immediately transferred to the San Martín hospital, she was hospitalized in serious condition and died on Monday the 26th.
> 
> Daniel Silvestrilli was detained in Prison Unit Number 36 of the Buenos Aires Penitentiary Service. According to the information provided by the Prosecutor's Office No. 2 of La Plata to Present, that Friday the man was not complying with his temporary exit regime and an arrest warrant was released for him. Silvestrilli was already serving a sentence of 9 years and six months in prison for aggravated robbery. For the woman's death, the accused must face charges of ""homicide in the context of gender violence.""

 
Nicol was a parent who leaves behind two teenagers, and often cared for others in her community.

> Nicol was 35 years old and the mother of two teenagers. Her family emphasizes that she was the one who ran the house and was in charge of finances. During the pandemic, when the housing situation was extreme for the LGBT population , Nicol was supportive and took care of housing and asking for help for her colleagues who had nowhere to live.
> 
> The Otrans Civil Association, with whom she collaborated, remembered Nicol and demanded justice for his crime. “We express to her family and friends our deepest condolences and deep pain for the [murder] of our partner Nicol Ruiz. Likewise, we demand justice, taking into account the aggravating circumstance of hatred of self-perceived gender identity,"" the statement said. 
> 
> “Nicol was a breadwinner, the mother of two children, who after her death are left without his protection. It becomes essential, to be part of the emotional agenda of our country and for society to mourn and be horrified when they kill a fellow [trans person]”. 
> 
> Nicol Ruiz suffered from kidney failure and had to undergo dialysis treatment. For this reason, they estimate, the blow caused the immediate formation of a clot in her head that complicated the situation. Nicol's family and her friends called for a demonstration to be held on Wednesday, September 28 at 11 am in front of Prosecutor's Office 7 (at calles 56 and 57, La Plata) with the slogan ""enough violence for travestis and trans"".
