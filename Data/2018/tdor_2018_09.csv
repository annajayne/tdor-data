According to a police report, a preliminary investigation revealed that Tucker had a brief argument with an unknown person or persons inside a black Ford pickup truck, and that person or persons began shooting at her.

Police are looking for a suspect.

> Shantee lived and died in my home state of Pennsylvania. There are no hate crimes protections under state law. There are no nondiscrimination protections under state law. Our state government has never passed anything promoting the welfare, safety & value of the trans community or the LGBTQ community writ large. Our school districts are wrestling with seemingly simple matters like bathroom safety while our entire state grapples with the realities of racial injustice and white supremacy. We talk about these things, but I don’t see much in the way of taking action.

In December 2018 Juan Salazar-Diaz, 21, was arrested.

> Juan Salazar-Diaz, 21, was the last person Tyren Anthony Kinard called before she was killed, police said.

Her body was found dumped behind some gravel pits alongside the I-35 highway.

He was arrested early on Saturday 15th September after Erika Pena (who very nearly became another victim) managed to escape and raise the alarm two days earlier . After her escape he went on to kill twice more before being apprehended.

Ortiz has been charged with the murder of Nikki and three cisgender women (Melissa Ramirez, Claudine Anne Luera, and one victim who has not yet been unidentified) as well as kidnapping Erika. His trial is scheduled for April 2022.

The US authorities did not initially release Nikki's name, nationality or when she died, but in death the state misgendered her by referring to her as ""John Doe"". Juan David Ortiz may have ended her life, but the US authorities then spat on her grave in a way which is all too familiar to trans folks everywhere.

> She [Nikki] is the second Latina trans Texan we have lost this year, the third trans Latina in the US murdered this year, and the 21st trans person this year violently taken from us.    
> 
> And once again, she is the tenth trans person under age 30 we've violently lost in 2018 and the 18th trans person of color.   17 of those trans POC have ben trans women.  We have also had one Black trans man killed this year who also ID as gender non conforming.
> 
> When will the lives of Latinx trans folks become just as valuable to cis Latinx folks?    When will we see an end to the murders of trans people, no matter what their ethnic background?
> 
> Rest in power and peace, Nikki   You can begin to rest soundly knowing that the person who killed you is in custody.  Your trans family and all who loved you in the Lone Star State and around the country will be watching and waiting to see if the Webb County DA handles his business and you get justice for the abrupt end of your all too brief life.

> The Rainbow ATC association has called a concentration of rejection and in defense of the rights of the LGTBI collective on October 20 in Valladolid. ""What happened has no justification whatsoever and I hope it is the last aggression against a transsexual person that occurs in our city (...) Many people in our association are frightened because this aggression, although it is the most serious, is not the only one that has taken place lately in Valladolid"", has expressed their spokesman, Lunara Santamaría.
> 
> ATC Rainbow does not doubt at any time about the transphobic component of the aggression beyond the theft of the mobile phone. On her Twitter they published: "" Ely was beaten to death, dressed as a woman since she was known for her gender expression as Ely "".
> 
> ""There is no doubt that it was due to transphobia, "" says Mar Cambrollé, president of the Trans collective. From the platform they ask for legal protection of the right to self-determination of sexual identity and gender expression. This law was registered on February 23 by the Unidos Podemos party in Congress, but has not yet been enacted.

He was on a waiting list for an NHS Gender Identity Clinic and was struggling with the delays involved.

> A transgender Cambridgeshire teenager took his own life after delays accessing gender affirming treatment on the NHS, a coroner's court heard today (March 29).
> 
> Jayden Lowe's death on September 22, 2018, followed the recent breakdown of a relationship he kept hidden from his parents.
> 
> The aspiring art student, of Meldreth, was born [deadname], but told doctors when he was 16 he knew from an early age he was a boy and changed his name by deed poll at the age of 17. Despite support offered by his local GP, an inquest heard how he struggled to get help to transition on the NHS and resorted to buying hormone replacement treatment online.
> 
> His mother Claire Lowe said her son had told to her about a month before his death, he had to be referred to an adult clinic because he was turning 18.
> 
> This meant an additional two-year wait for treatment, the coroner's court heard.
> 
> Mother Claire said Jayden told her: ""I can't carry on living like this.""
> 
> She said: ""That's why we allowed him to go online to seek his solution. We backed him because he was desperate. He was just living for the day he would just be a proper boy"". She also recalled how Jayden told her: ""You don't deserve a trans kid, it's not fair,"" and she had reassured him: ""We don't want another kid.""
> 
> She said: ""He thought it was unreasonable he had to live half girl, half boy. Since he started taking the testosterone we thought that things were looking up but that was maybe too little, too late.""
> 
> In a statement, a specialist in gender reassignment, who Jayden had a consultation with, noted the one transition clinic in London's Tavistock Square had ""extensive waiting lists, not in accordance with the NHS constitution"". He said Jayden had been on a child and adolescent waiting list for 11 months but because he was turning 18 was not eligible and would have to wait an additional two years to be seen in an adult clinic.
>
> In a statement Jayden's father Neil Lowe, recalled how his son had good grades in all his studies, was doing A-Levels, and wanted to go on to study History of Art at Oxford University. He said from an early age Jayden wanted to be known as 'Jess' and the family were aware he was transgender. However, long waiting lists for NHS reassignment treatment had forced the teen to ""give up"" and order male hormone treatment online. He said: ""Jayden has started taking these very recently before his death.""

Jayden's death was not recorded on the official TDoR 2018 list released by Transgender Europe (TGEU).

In mid-October Ambra's friends held a mass for her in the parish of San Sabino.

> ""After Ambra's death there was only silence, apart from the newspaper articles published on the day of the murder, nothing more, nothing has been said of her case, but we hope that the institutions are moving, that come to the truth about who killed her"".
> 
> Alessia is one of Ambra's friends, the 40-year-old transsexual found dead on September 23 in her car in San Giorgio, killed with a knife at the base of her neck. She is the spokesperson for transgender girls who, together, have decided to organize a commemoration dedicated to their friend who is no longer there. Tonight at 7 pm, in the parish of San Sabino, they will meet for a mass in memory of Ambra.“

A year later her murder was still unsolved.

> It was September 23, 2018 when in San Giorgio, in via Alfredo Giovine on the southern waterfront of Bari, the lifeless body of Ambra was found, a dead trans girl stabbed in the night. A murder that, after a year, does not yet have a culprit, does not yet have a motive, does not yet have an explanation. The murder weapon has never been found, just as it is difficult to establish with certainty what Ambra was doing in that dark lane, on a night between Saturday and Sunday. The hypothesis most accredited by the investigators is that Ambra was there [for sex work], but it is still not clear if it was an attempt of robbery gone wrong, or of violent action by a client.
>
> ""It was a femicide, and as such we should treat it"", the conviction of her friend Alessia Nobile one year after that tragic day. ""I knew her well, we were the same age and we started together on the path to sex change,"" recalls her friend. ""Ambra was a good, naive person; who knows, maybe it was her ingenuity that led her to that street where she met death,"" continues Alessia.

It is possible that her death was accidental as her body did not show traces of violence - however the lack of evidence of the bike coming off the road suggested otherwise. A post-mortem exaimation may  reveal more.

> ""We are facing another case of a hate crime, and there have already been 61 murders of transgender people"" since the end of Alfredo Stroessner's dictatorship in Paraguay in 1989, Acosta said. He added that, so far, ""none of these cases has been clarified,"" despite the fact that in some of these murders, ""the confessed perpetrators"" of the crimes were arrested.
