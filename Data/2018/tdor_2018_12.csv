She had been shot.

Authorities were initially investigating claims by a 46-year-old man who told officers that he was robbed in the area and fired a shot, but is unsure if he hit the trans woman. However, on Monday 10th December Sterling Heights Baptist pastor Albert Weathers, 46, was charged with her murder. 

> The murder which had previously thought to be the result of a robbery gone bad might, in fact, be a  hate crime.
> 
> Albert Weathers, pastor of The New Mt. Olive Primitive Baptist Church and more recently Logos Baptist Church is charged with open murder and use of a firearm in the commission of a felony. The 36th District Court set bond at $1 million according to The Detroit News.

Keanna was an activist. In 2015, she was quoted in UK based newspaper The Guardian speaking about the Detroit police department:

> “The police are unaware with our struggle so they have no sympathy for us,” she told the Guardian. “Nobody ever asks, what happened to that person to get here?”
> 
> Keanna was quoted in the Guardian speaking on the death of a trans woman, Amber Monroe [1]. This morning, she was killed a few blocks from where Amber died.

She died at the scene.

Another trans woman who was also attacked managed to escape.

> According to information from the Military Police, a silver Citroen passed several times on East West Avenue, on the corner of Cape Verde Street, and then stopped when three men disembarked. The suspects attacked the two [trans women] and one resisted.

The car was found abandoned a few minutes later, and Anderson Aparecido dos Santos Pires was arrested. The suspect claimed to have been robbed, stabbed and his car stolen, but a witness recognised him as one of the three perpetrators of the murder.

Kenny Roger Fioravante Pereira and José Mauro Lopes da Silva were also detained. Pires was charged with murder, and Pereira and da Silva with attempted murder. All three have been held in pre-trial detention since their arrest. José Mauro Lopes da Silva is due to go to trial on 4th April 2022.


On Monday 4th April 2022 José Mauro Lopes da Silva was sentenced to nine years and 15 days in prison for her murder.

> Defendant José Mauro Lopes da Silva was sentenced to nine years and 15 days in prison for the murder of [trans woman] Scarlety Mastroiany in a popular jury that took place this Monday (4th) in Londrina.
>
> After more than 10 hours of trial, the sentence was announced on Monday night by Judge Paulo César Roldão. Having served three years in a closed regime, the sentence dropped to six years in a semi-open regime and the defendant will be able to appeal the sentence in freedom.
>
> The trial was marked by demonstrations by the Frente Trans de Londrina, which organized a vigil in front of the Forum of the Comarca de Londrina to ask for justice for the death of Scarlety Mastroiany, murdered in the early hours of December 10, 2018, while working on Avenida Leste. She was attacked by three men with punches, kicks and stabs, along with her friend Bianca Duarte, a survivor of the attacks.
>
> The defendants, who were caught red-handed on the same date as the crime, were indicted for qualified homicide with a clumsy motive, ""since they acted because of the hatred and prejudice they felt towards the victims for being [trans] and carrying out sexual programs"", accused the Public Ministry.

> 
> In social networks, various groups of the LGBT community condemned the crime. The human rights activist of the gay community, Orlando Pastor Santos, condemned the homicide and criticized the authorities for making homophobic crimes invisible and no one talking about them.
>
> Pastor Santos said that in 2018 they have counted five crimes for homophobia, two in Acapulco, two in Iguala and Denisse Hernández Rivero. ""The state of Guerrero is ranked fifth for transphobic crimes. The problem in the entity is that trans people are just figures, the government only counts how many deaths go, but never resolves anything, and when they are feminicide or important people it is a tragedy, ""he lamented. The activist denounced that there is institutional discrimination and transphobia towards the gay community, ""we are tired of this situation, although there is already a Specialized Prosecutor's Office in Guerrero, they do nothing. We are afraid,"" he said.

Two cars then ran over her body, crushing her skull. The second was a police vehicle.

> The car that passed over the body did not have blood marks on the front or side. The victim had her skull crushed, but this, according to the theory of the denunciations, occurred before the trampling. ""The body was thrown in the middle of the runway to look like it was an accident,"" commented one reader.

Shortly before she died she had reportedly had an argument with a man in a shop.
