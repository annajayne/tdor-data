He went missing on the evening of 2nd August amid reports by friends that he had been injured in a bar.

Reportedly he had gone there to celebrate the birth of the baby of a couple of friends.

> One witness said that at about 3am, when he returned from the bathroom he heard someone complain about the disappearance of a cell phone. At this point, ""he pulled the gun from his waist and placed it on the table, saying that no one would leave the place until the cell phone appeared, identifying himself as a police officer.""
> 
> About 40 minutes later, according to his friends, four men invaded the place, three of them hooded, carrying guns. The police officer, according to the report, was shot twice and taken by the men.

The Military Police found his body dead in the trunk of a car at Cristalino Rolim de Freitas Street in the Campo Grande neighborhood at around 7:50pm on Monday 6th August. He had been shot in the groin and head.

Press reports of his disappearance and murder initially erased his identity by deadnaming Dudu and reporting him as being a lesbian.

She died in custody on 4th August 2018 in the men's wing of a Direct Provision centre in Galway.

> Just heard the heartbreaking news about a trans woman found dead in direct provision. We need to end the horrific practice of Direct Provision. Seeking asylum is not a crime so why are we locking up asylum seekers! #EndDirectProvision #DublinTransPride

In early June 2019 the local LGBT+ community discovered that the Irish authorities had buried Silva's body the previous month without notifying them or offering them the chance to hold a memorial service for her.

> On the 2nd August 2018 Sylva Tukula died. Sylva was a dear friend of the LGBT+ community in Galway city and, in particular, of AMACH! LGBT+ Galway and our resource centre, [Teach Solais](https://www.facebook.com/184455662036757/). Due to Sylva’s status as an International Protection Applicant in Ireland, the Department of Justice and Equality were obligated to investigate the circumstances of her death, to liaise with friends and fellow residents of the Direct Provision centre where she lived, and to make culturally-appropriate burial arrangements. Close friends and colleagues of Sylva were assured by both national and local State representatives that we would be notified once arrangements were made. Sadly, we were recently informed that our dear friend was buried by the State at the beginning of May. Members of our community and, especially those close to Sylva, were devastated to hear of her burial with no-one close to her present.
>
> We had the understanding that we would be made aware of the funeral arrangements in advance so that our community, Sylva’s Galway family, could be a part of this service, and to ensure that her life was celebrated on the day of her burial. We continually checked with Government representatives for updates, while receiving no new information regarding any arrangements. The fact that Sylva’s burial occurred in the absence of a ceremony, and without attendance, is deeply offensive to everyone close to Sylva, particularly members of the LGBT+ community who lived in the Great Western, who knew her from the Eglinton Direct Provision centres in Galway City and those that met her throughout her life in Galway. This abhorrent news has left many in shock, with those in the direct provision sites feeling that they will be buried alone thousands of miles away from people they grew up with by the Irish State. Anyone who has had a loved one pass away would empathise with how this has affected those that knew her, and how devastating this act would feel.
>
> We are left with more questions than answers as to how this has been allowed to occur. Our dear friend Sylva was failed by the system in which she was entrapped, in many ways; yet at all times she bore these failings with grace, with dignity and with a warm smile. We strongly request this matter be investigated both to the fullest possible extent and in a timely manner, to establish how this system failed our friend Sylva this last, final time. In her honour we must ensure that this tragic outcome does not occur again, to anyone.
>
> AMACH! LGBT+ intend to work with those who knew and loved Sylva to mark her burial and celebrate her life. We would ask that media respect the privacy of all those affected by this news. Anyone who wishes to be a part of this event is encouraged to contact us""

She was found ""naked, stabbed, with a bleeding wound in the chest"".

> 7 to 8 men attacked her. This follows other previous attacks. It would probably be a gang of men who regularly assault sex workers and their clients to steal from them. This band phenomenon targeting female sex workers is currently developing throughout the Ile de France region. Those who try to organize themselves to defend themselves and chase them are then attacked separately.
> 
> Today we mourn this loss and feel as usual abandoned. The murders of trans women sex workers are not rare. This is a recurring phenomenon and we regularly try to alert public opinion and the authorities to this violence. Unfortunately as always, we find ourselves alone.
> 
> Why does the life of trans women migrant sex workers matter so little? Why are our deaths treated only as news? Why are journalists so ignorant or so disrespectful that they say ""a transvestite prostitute"" is dead and continue to begrudge me into death? Does not the life of a bitch count?
> 
> We have in us this strange impression that our dead do not arouse any emotion. For us, there is never national mourning. There is never an official commemoration. The political class remains silent. Once the sensationalist press articles are over, it's the return to silence, and we have to go back to work with fear, waiting to be next.

Nine individuals were subsequently arrested in connection with her death. In January 2022 Mahmoud Kadri, 24, Karim Ibrahim, 29 and Aymen Dib, 25, went on trial for murder.

> Vanesa Campos, a 36-year-old trans [sex worker] was shot in the chest on the night of August 16-17, 2018 in the Boulogne forest, a place that is known for the presence of sex workers.
>
> To protect herself from the vandals, Vanesa Campos had hired a bodyguard. However this was not sufficient a measure against this gang since they arrived armed with tear gas canisters, a knife and an electric pistol.
>
> Days before, a firearm had been stolen from a policeman's vehicle while en he was with another sex worker and would be used to commit the crime.
>
> One of the shots fired fatally wounded Vanesa Campos. The prosecution considers Mahmoud Kadri, 24, to be the author of the fatal shot. Karim Ibrahim, 29, and Aymen Dib, 25, are also charged with participating; hitting and stabbing her, respectively.

In late January 2022 Mahmoud Kadri and Karim Ibrahim were sentenced to 22 years in prison for her murder. Six other defendents were sentenced to between 3 and 6 years.

> French justice sentenced two Egyptians to 22 years in prison this Saturday for the 2018 death of Vanesa Campos, a trans-Peruvian sex worker, on the outskirts of Paris.
>
> The sentences pronounced by the Paris criminal chamber against Mahmoud Kadri and Karim Ibrahim , for ""homicide in an organized gang"", are higher than those requested by the prosecution, of 20 and 15 years. Six other defendants for the same act were sentenced to three to six years in prison.

Despite coming out as gay, it looks like Jamel may have been evolving towards a trans identity.

> Over the summer, his mom said he came out to her as gay.
> 
> ""And he looked so scared when he told me. He was like, 'Mom, I’m gay.' And I thought he was playing, so I looked back because I was driving, and he was all curled up, so scared. And I said, 'I still love you',"" Pierce said.
> 
> Pierce said her son wanted to tell his classmates.
> 
> ""He went to school and said he was gonna tell people he’s gay because he’s proud of himself,"" she said.
> 
> Pierce said when he came out, he opened up about wanting to dress more femininely.
> 
> ""And he goes, 'Can I be honest with you?'"" Pierce said. ""And I was like sure, and he’s like, 'I know you buy me boy stuff because I’m a boy, but I’d rather dress like a girl.'""
> 
> On Thursday, four days into the school year, Jamel took his own life. Pierce found her son dead in their Denver home. She said he killed himself after being bullied.
> 
> ""Four days is all it took at school. I could just imagine what they said to him,"" Pierce said. ""My son told my oldest daughter the kids at school told him to kill himself. I’m just sad he didn’t come to me.""

We can't know whether Jamel would have eventually come out as trans, but that quote suggests they might well have. Either way, bullying kills - and no child should ever feel the need to take their own life.

> Ateş lived in the Beyoğlu district of Istanbul. Sources say she was arguing with a person loitering outside her apartment building on Friday night. As a result, the man stabbed her and cut her throat. According to Evrensel, Ateş was a sex worker and the man she was arguing with was one of her clients.

> Law enforcement officials and crime scene investigators are currently looking into the suspect and reviewing evidence. The forensic morgue removed Ateş’s body.

> In the case, where the fourth hearing was held at the Istanbul 5th High Criminal Court, the court ruled that the conditions of legitimate defense and unjust provocation that the killer Olcay Saka had put forward in his defense did not occur.
>
> The court sentenced Saka to life imprisonment for deliberate murder (Article 81/1 of the Turkish Penal Code). Considering the “negative effects of killer Saka” on the future, the court converted life imprisonment to 25 years with a discount of discretion.
