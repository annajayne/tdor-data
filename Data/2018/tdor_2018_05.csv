Karla was only 18 years old, and just beginning her life. Blogger Monica Roberts shared this:

> Karla is the 9th person we have lost to anti-trans violence this year in the US. She's the seventh trans person of color and the second trans Latina we have lost in the US in 2018.
> 
> She also the first trans person in Texas we have lost this year. This murder also is infuriating me not only because it happened in my home state, but because she was just 18 years old.

> She was just beginning to embark on her life journey, and who knows what Karla could have accomplished had she been allowed to simply live her life.

She was a refugee from Honduras, and had fled to the USA after threats from MS-13.

> Hernández Rodriguez had told Buzzfeed, months before her death, ""she was walking home when MS-13 gang members started screaming 'We don't want you in this neighborhood, you fucking faggot' at her before gang-raping her.""
> 
> ""Four of them raped me and as a result I got HIV,"" Hernandez told BuzzFeed News. ""Trans people in my neighborhood are killed and chopped into pieces, then dumped inside potato bags.""

She was being held at the privately run Cibola Correctional Facility in Milan, New Mexico. An inquest found that her death occurred after medical treatment was withheld, and that she was most likely beaten while in ICE custody.

> The private prison facility at the Cibola County Correctional Center in New Mexico is operated by CoreCivic, the second-largest private prison company in the U.S. CoreCivic, co-founded by a former GOP chairman, operates more than 65 facilities and has come under fire for poor staffing and extensive lobbying efforts.
> 
> ""There she developed severe diarrhea and vomiting over the course of several days,"" the autopsy states, ""and finally was emergently hospitalized, then transported to Lovelace Medical Center in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where she remained critically ill until her death.""
> 
> ""According to observations of other detainees who were with Ms. Hernández Rodriguez, the diarrhea and vomiting episodes persisted over multiple days with no medical evaluation or treatment, until she was gravely ill,"" forensic pathologist Kris Sperry wrote.
> 
> The autopsy ""also found evidence of physical abuse, with 'deep bruising' on her hands and abdomen, evidence of blunt-force trauma 'indicative of blows, and/or kicks, and possible strikes with blunt object.' An accompanying diagram illustrated long, thin bruises along Hernández Rodriguez’s back and sides, as well as extensive hemorrhaging on Hernández Rodriguez’s right and left wrists, which Dr. Sperry found were 'typical of handcuff injuries.'""

It has been repeatedly reported that asylum seekers at the border are held in freezing holding cells (often referred to as ""hieleras"") for days. Cibola is a facility for male inmates, which also suggests abusive behaviour by the authorities.

> ""Paired with the abuse we know transgender people regularly suffer in ICE detention, the death of Ms. Hernández sends the message that transgender people are disposable and do not deserve dignity, safety, or even life,"" said Isa Noyola, Deputy Director at Transgender Law Center.
> 
> ""It is alarming that transgender communities continue to face transphobic violence outside and inside of detention walls,"" says Flor Bermudez, Legal Director at Transgender Law Center. ""This is why TLC's Trans Immigrant Defense Effort (TIDE) has organized to demand the liberation of transgender women from detention and the end of all detention and deportations. ICE has shown time and again it is incapable of protecting transgender women in detention. Transgender people should not be detained by ICE, at all.""
> 
> ""We have been demanding the release of our trans communities detained in ICE detention centers because of rampant physical and brutal treatment from guards and other detainees,"" said Jorge Gutiérrez, Executive Director of Familia: Trans Queer Liberation Movement.
> 
> ""At a time when we are grieving the murders of transgender women of color, and the murder of 20 year-old Claudia Patricia Gómez Gonzalez by Border Patrol at the Texas-Mexico border, it is unconscionable that a transgender woman would die in the hands of ICE at the Cibola trans pod in immigration detention. The community, now more than ever, needs to organize to protect our most vulnerable, in particular transgender immigrant women who are surrounded by violence on a daily basis,"" added Anandrea Molina, President of Organización Latina de Trans en Texas.
> 
> Transgender immigrants often seek asylum, withholding of removal or protection under the Convention Against Torture because of violence, rape and torture they have experienced in their countries of origin due to their gender identity or expression. However, once inside the United States, transgender immigrants may often face similar risks, as well as criminalization, as they are targeted and harassed by police or held in detention where they experience violence, discrimination, and an inability to access to medical care, all of which may lead to dire consequences.

Subsequently it emerged that ICE had illegally deleted surveillance footage and other evidence.

> Phoenix (AZ) - The Transgender Law Center (TLC) organization filed a lawsuit on Wednesday for the alleged removal of a surveillance video and other evidence on the case of the undocumented transgender Roxsana Hernández Rodríguez , who died in ICE custody at a facility in New Mexico detention .
>
> The 33-year-old Honduran died nine days after being transferred to a unit dedicated to transgender women at the Cibola County Correctional Center in New Mexico, which is operated by CoreCivic, the country's second largest private prison company.
>
> Anna Castro, a spokesman for Transgender Law Center (TLC), told Efe that the lawsuit is against CoreCivic, ""and not only for the video, but for all the evidence that may have a connection with Roxsana during the time she remained in Cibola.""
>
> The organization and lawyers say that, by federal rule, ICE must preserve material that can serve as evidence, including electronic recordings.

This is why their first name has been abbreviated and gender neutral pronouns are being used - quite honestly it's the safest thing to do in cases like this. More information may come to light to clarify things, or it may not.

She died at the scene.

Sophia Adler (33) has been arrested and charged with murder.

According to friends Gigi was in the early stages of transition, and was homeless at the time of her murder.

> My Bébé was an incredibly loving, gifted, beautiful disaster,"" says Jason Johnson, who formerly dated Pierce. ""I don't want her to be reduced to a statistic, a number, or a stereotype.""
> 
> Friends described Pierce as both ""full of laughter and light"" and ""deeply troubled."" She grappled all year with transitioning, starting to identify as Gigi. Many in Portland's LGBTQ community still knew her by her male-assigned name and pronouns and did not know she was trans, according to friend Dawn Higgins-Wither.

Local news station KATU spoke to a witness they called Amber:

> ""I heard Gigi say, 'Don't touch me,'"" Amber told KATU. ""And the woman came up and hit Gigi in the face with her purse. That kinda set Gigi off. Gigi went to hit her, pulled back to hit her and the next thing I know my ear's ringing. There had been a gunshot. It all happened so fast. It always does. It all happened so fast.""

He was pronounced dead at 2am on Wednesday 30th May.

Marty was originally from Sofia in Bulgaria and had been studying English and French literature at Cardiff University. He had been diagnosed with gender dysphoria by a GP in 2017 and referred to an NHS gender identity clinic.

It is not known whether NHS waiting lists, treatment delays or the way he was treated by clinicians contributed to his suicide, but sadly this has to be a distinct possibility - two months earlier Jacob Whelan had died by suicide in the same city after struggling with long NHS treatment delays.

[See https://tdor.translivesmatter.info/reports/2018/03/17/jacob-whelan_cardiff-wales-united-kingdom_3097f77d]

> In a written statement provided to the court, Marty's father Marian Dragonova described Marty as having an ""interest in languages, particularly English and French"" and said Marty had wanted to study in the UK for years.
> 
> Assistant Coroner Graeme Hughes said it was clear that Marty intended to take their own life.
> 
> He said: ""On the 29th of May, [he] had consumed an extremely high amount of caffeine with the intention to take [his] own life.
> 
> ""[He] was discovered by [his] flatmate and [he] was taken to hospital but died shortly after. My conclusion is that how Marty came about [his] death is one of suicide.""
