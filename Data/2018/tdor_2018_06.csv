In October 2021 Júnior Everton Menegildo was convicted of femicide and sentenced to 14 years, 10 months and 10 days in prison.

> The Capital Jury Court unanimously sentenced the defendant Júnior Everton Menegildo to 14 years, 11 months and 10 days in prison this week, accused of the violent murder of transsexual Kamylla Roberta ([deadname]) in the north of the island.
>
> In the indictment, the Attorney André Otávio Mello acted, who upheld a thesis unpublished in Santa Catarina: that the defendant had also committed the crime of femicide, due to the fact that he lived with the “woman” murdered using an iron bar while she slept. In addition to the violence, he fled with the victim's car to Itapema, where he was arrested four days later.
>
> The Judgment Council accepted the Public Ministry's thesis that the victim had the female gender as an identity and unanimously condemned the defendant for the practice of doubly qualified homicide. Prosecutor André Otávio highlighted: ""The law that guarantees greater protection to women does not only refer to the biological sex, but also covers every human being who considers herself to be female."" He invoked violence against women, citing the Federal Constitution in the week in which it completed 33 years since its enactment.

>
> According to the report of the police corporations, it was around 9:00 p.m. on Tuesday, when the officers moved to the house marked with number 680 due to the report of a family fight. Upon arrival, the officers found a young transsexual [woman] lifeless and in a pool of blood, as well as the alleged perpetrator of the crime, who was immediately arrested.

> The organization Diana Sacayán, of which Nataly Briyith Sánchez was part, condemned and lamented the crime as well as pointing out that they live in a state that ""does not recognize our identity and that discriminates against us. A state that does not provide us with the legal tools to fully access, and according to the parameters of human rights, our rights. ""
> 
> They demand from the Attorney General of the State that this crime ""be investigated as femicide and the maximum penalty against aggressor be requested."" Failure to do so, they add, would be to discriminate against it for reasons of gender identity, ""even though the Mexican State has the obligation to recognize the identity of the persons, even if the modifications in the official documents have not been made.""

She died by suicide. In death her identity was erased by family and she was buried ""as a man"".

> This is what happens when you don’t have support from your family. Her legal name was Laura and that’s how I will remember her. And people wonder why trans people have such a high rate of suicide.......
> 
> At least we had a ritual for her last night and celebrated her true self. I’m so sorry that they have done this to you Laura.
> 
> I just posted this as a remembrance on the obituary page of the funeral home. Since it has to be approved by the funeral director I'm sure it will never see the light of day.....
> 
> ""I never knew ""Larry"" but I was a friend of Dr. Laura Masi which was her legal name at the time of her death. Laura was a warm, caring, funny, vivacious and spiritual woman. It is a shame that you never got to know the remarkable woman she had become. We held a ceremony for Laura last night honoring her in a way that respected her, her life and her wishes. It is the refusal of people to recognize a trans persons basic human dignity that leads to tragedies such as this unnecessary death. She will be remembered by those of us who knew the real her as a beautiful woman, a shining feminine spirit and a cautionary tale of what happens to a transgender individual who is not accepted by their loved ones.""
