Gender identity clinic (""GIC"") provision in the UK is extremely inadequate given the size of the trans population, resulting in long waiting lists (typically 18-24 months, and rising) for even a first appointment. During this period, no in-person support is offered and patients are basically left to cope on their own.

> Giving evidence at an inquest into his death held at Pontypridd Coroner's Court on Thursday, Mr Whelan's close friend Joshua Barnett said he had been suffering with numerous medical issues including type one diabetes, coeliac disease, dyspraxia, and dyslexia for much of his life.
> 
> Mr Barnett said this, on top of his decision to begin to transition his gender in 2017, had been the source of a tremendous amount of ""frustration"" for Mr Whelan.
> 
> ""There were two different aspects to it,"" Mr Barnett said. ""It was the medical side where he was finding it very difficult to wait for the appointments he wanted.
> 
> ""Because he made the decision to go private he was also paying for it. I think that was what he was using his money for.""

Jesse McDonald, 24, of Hounslow, appeared at Uxbridge Magistrates’ Court on Tuesday 20th March charged with murder. He was convicted and jailed for life in October 2018.

Neko had realised that she was female in 2016 and started hormone therapy. She attended university in Utah (USA), but was forced to terminate her studies and return home to China after her parents terminated her fees.

After returning China, Neko lived in Shanghai until her parents found her and her father intimidated her into going back home to Yunnan with them. She finally escaped his abuse by dying by suicide several days after he forcibly enrolled her in a militarised training camp.

> While her friend was defending her in front of her father and suggesting sending her to a hospital in Beijing, Neko’s father beat her heavily.
> 
> Neko’s father once rudely said that her friend should not “interfere with their domestic issues” while he received Neko’s friend’s call to check her up. Her father even refused to pay the medical fee, claiming that he did not have the responsibility when Neko had medical emergencies and needed to go to the hospital.
> 
> On 16 March 2018 Neko was sent by her father to a militarized training camp, Kunming Anning Good Children Sansheng Education and Training School, which claims to provide “specialized education for those Children who are rebellious, autistic, hate school or have internet addiction disorder” with entirely closed, forceful and militarized management and strict surveillance system.
> 
> Neko sent her close friends signals for help. When her close friend tried to contact her, it transpired that Neko’s mobile phone was lost, and her parents refused to reply. Her friend said that she tried to call the police, but it did not change anything.
> 
> The police claimed that they could not help, telling her that even an adult with depression at any degree with or without the certificate of incapacity “could be forcibly controlled” by parents as guardians.

Neko was an Anime, Minecraft and design enthusiast. She wrote articles on design and technology using her Github account at https://nekomeowww.github.io/.
