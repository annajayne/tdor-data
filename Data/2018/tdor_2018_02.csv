Initial news reports deadnamed and misgendered her.

> Not long after I learned about the murder of Tonya Harvey in Buffalo, because of the misgendering of her by law enforcement and Jacksonville, FL media, I’m just now discovering thanks to reader Kayla Gore about the murder of the fourth trans person we have lost to anti-trans violence in 2018 and the second we have lost this week in 36 year old Celine Walker.
> 
> Walker, who was from Brandon, FL , was found shot to death in a room at the Extended Stay America on Skinner Lake Drive near St John Town Center. The Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office was called to the location after Walker’s body was found at 8 PM EST Sunday.
> 
> The reason the media has misgendered her is because it started with the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office, who is claiming they have a policy that does not refer to victims as transgender. 
> Well Jacksonville Sheriff’s Department, y’all need to deal with the reality that trans people exists, because it was not only disrespectful to refer to Celine as a man, not stating from the outset that a transgender female was murdered (see how easy that was Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office) has delayed your investigation
> 
> Many of us in the trans community who know her don’t know, don’t want to know or don’t care to know a trans person’s dead name. If you tell us what your name is, we respect that. 
> 
> And her Black trans life mattered.

In September 2019 police arrested Sean Bernhard Phoenix and charged him with murder and evidence tampering.

> A 21-year-old man has been charged with murder in the 2018 shooting death of transgender woman Celine Walker in Jacksonville.
>
> Walker, 36, also known as Erika, was shot several times and killed at the Extended Stay America hotel in Jacksonville’s Southpoint neighborhood on Feb. 4, 2018. Police found several shell casings and DNA evidence at the crime scene.
>
> The Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office investigated the crime for more than a year before finally arresting Sean Bernard Phoenix and charging him with murder. He has also been charged with evidence tampering.
>
> Police say Phoenix admitted to shooting Walker during an interrogation, and that he then sold the murder weapon to a stranger.

Johanna Cardenas Gutierrez,43,,,,4-Feb-2018,,,,"Cinisello Balsamo, Milan",Lombardy,Italy,45.556058,9.214011,violence,shot,"Johanna was murdered by a client. Her body was found at home by her roommate.

> Her roommate had found her lying on her bed in a flat in Cinisello Balsamo, a trickle of blood from her mouth. Nothing led her to think it was a violent death; but the 43-year-old found corpse on 4 February was killed by a blow to the back, discovered during the autopsy. In light of the results of the examination, filed in recent hours in the offices of the prosecutor's office in Monza, that of the Carabinieri of Sesto San Giovanni therefore becomes an investigation for homicide.
>
> Johana was Peruvian with Argentine nationality and had been in Italy for several years, according to initial investigations by the Carabinieri. She offered sexual services both at home, a basement that she shared with another [trans woman], and on the road, on the border between Sesto San Giovanni and Cinisello Balm. She was a film lover, reserved, with no criminal record and her acquaintances have described her as a person who in her private life had never had stormy relationships and never a discussion or a quarrel at work.
>
> No one, for friends or clients, could have wanted her dead. No one, according to the testimonies collected by the investigators of the weapon, would have had a reason to hurt her. Especially the roommate who, coming back home on February 4th, at first he thought she was sleeping. 
>
> Then, when she entered the room and noticed her lying on the bed still dressed apart from her shirt, tried to call her but to no avail. When she turned on the light, she noticed blood from her mouth had stained the sheets and sounded the alarm.

Giovanni Amato, 42, was subsequently arrested for Johanna's murder. In October 2018 he was sentenced to 18 years in prison.

> A 42-year-old Italian, Giovanni Amato, was arrested by the Carabinieri in execution of an order for custody in prison issued by the magistrate of Monza because he would have killed a 43-year-old Peruvian transsexual on 4 February in Cinisello Balsamo, in Milanese. The man is accused of aggravated voluntary homicide. The weapon used by the killer is a small ""pen-gun"".
>
> The victim had been found by his roommate on the bed, with blood coming out of his mouth. The coroner had ruled out a violent death in the first instance. The autopsy then confirmed the presence of a small gunshot hole on the back and the investigations of the Carabinieri of Sesto San Giovanni (Milan) have revealed that the weapon used by the killer is just a small pen-gun. 
>
> The man arrested, Giovanni Amato, is a 43-year-old garbage collector: the arrest was made by the Carabinieri of Sesto San Giovanni (Milan). On the day following the crime he and an accomplice were also responsible for the robbery and gunshot wounding of a 35-year-old Chinese man, who owns a bar in Segrate (Milan). 

Johanna's murder was not recorded on the official TDoR 2018 memorial list released by Transgender Europe (TGEU) in November 2018.

http://www.dailypublic.com/articles/05152018/remembering-kita-harvey

> “When I first seen her I was traumatized how beautiful she was,” said Kita’s friend Ealise Watson, who recalled meeting her before her own male-to-female transition at age 15. “She was the epitome of looking like a woman.” Watson said Harvey was more of a “showgirl” than a “ballroom girl,” meaning she would perform in a cabaret style in nightclubs rather than “walk” in a ballroom fashion competition. 
> 
> In her transition, Kita was a fearless trailblazer. “I talked to her and she gave me a lot of advice on how she started her transition,” Johnson said. “She went to Mexico and when she came back, she set this LGBT community on fire.” To Johnson, she was a “sister.” They lived together, traveled together, and helped each other to survive.
> 
> “Throughout the years she gave me, you know, tactics—what I needed to do. She was a big staple in the LGBT community here in Western New York. She brought back a lot of things, she inspired a lot of young trans women that came out in this community around this time.”
> 
> She was bold, and bright, a talented singer, lyricist, and dancer. “Honestly, she was an entertainer,” said Mciver. “She was very good. We used to call her the rig queen because she could rig anything. She could take a T-shirt and turn it into a doll. She was very, very creative, very articulate.”

Her body was found in a car in the central suburb of Aro Valley at about 1pm on Sunday 11th February.
Paddy Jonathan Woods, 30, has been arrested and charged with her murder. He had met her on a dating website a couple of months before. Her aunt told the media that the family had comforted the killer after her death, not knowing police suspected he was responsible for killing her.

> Zena had been turning her life around before she died, her aunt Carol Campbell said.
> 
> She had struggled with addiction, but had just gotten onto a methadone programme two weeks before her death. Campbell, who Zena lived with for more than five years as a child, said she had only ever known her as a boy, one she described as a “lovable ratbag” with a troubled past.
> 
> “[She] overcame a lot. [Her] life was a struggle. It was a struggle, especially, with ADHD. But [she] muddled through. [She] had a struggle with drugs, with injecting. [She] had just decided ‘that’s it, I’m going to get clean’, and he got on the methadone programme and two weeks later [she] was dead.
> “[She] was starting to become happy, starting to get [her] life together.”
 
> Campbell hadn’t yet met with Zena since she began living as a woman, and is deeply sad she never will.
> She missed a birthday phone call from Zena on February 8. Zena was dead by February 11.

A candlelight vigil was held for Zena in Wellington on 20th March.

https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12016004

> Organiser Bella Simpson said it was important to acknowledge Campbell’s death, “that we say her name and give our community an opportunity to mourn together and to come together and remind each other how beautiful our transwhanau are”.
>
> “We’re not America where trans women are consistently getting murdered and everyone’s turning a blind eye. This is Wellington.
> “This is not something that we stand for. It’s not something that I’d say is within our values of who we are as a cultural, diverse city.”
> 
> Simpson said the vigil was also about moving forward and showing members of the transgender community they were supported and loved.
> “We’ve lost someone from our family, we’re going to come together and we’re going to take over some space and we’re going to hold that space for each other.”

> Ekai was being followed up in the Gender Unit of Cruces Hospital but, despite the struggle of his parents Ana and Elaxar to get a hormonal treatment to stop their development, they had not succeeded. “The protocol is very strict and is conditioned by the opinion of doctors and psychiatrists. Normally, it is authorized from the age of 16 but for Ekai it is late “, denounce from the association, who demand that the start of the transit of these kids to their new identity is not conditioned by medical criteria. Nor did the training that the heads of the Basque Government had promised to give teachers and students of the institute where Ekai studied to avoid misunderstanding and humiliation. “They committed themselves in February of last year and they had not done anything yet.”
> 
> “The worst news, but we will continue fighting for the memory of Ekai and for those children and young people who are being denied their identity again and again,” explains Bea Sever, spokesperson for the association that welcomes families of transsexual minors.
> 
> Save the Children has also expressed consternation and support for the family, as well as demanding the need to guarantee the sexual identity and non-discrimination of transsexual adolescents. The non-governmental organization recalls that transgender minors are a “particularly vulnerable” group, which is why they deserve “special protection by public administrations”. “This protection must be based on equal treatment and non-discrimination, their mental well-being and respect for their best interests,” it said in a statement.

In February 2020 Ekai's story was documented in the short film ""Mi pequeño samurai"" [""My little samurai""] at the  Gaylesbotrans International Film and Performing Arts Festival in Bilbao.

> Today, after the publication of a story in the newspaper La Gaceta saying that it could be the young woman, one of Cynthia’s sisters wrote this message:

> “We still do not know who the murdered person is. They say she’s a trans girl but we do not know. I know Cynthia, and we’re waiting for her to appear. What we do know is that the girls of Tucumán are constantly in danger. In addition to feeling the anguish that they are killing us, that friends and acquaintances die, that because we are trans we are afraid of going out into the street and sometimes of going to the center to work. I do not know if I’m going back. I am afraid and it is not a sensation, it is a reality: they are killing us, they are destroying our bodies and our lives”, Mahia Moyano, an activist with LOTO (Freedom and Pride Trans Organized), told Presentes.

One suspect was arrested in September 2019, but Cynthia's family believe others were also involved.

> On February 14, 2018, Cynthia Moreira , 25, left home. Five days later her body was found, dismembered, inside two bags, by a man who was performing maintenance tasks in a house on 9 de Julio 1,500, in Villa Amalia. A member of the Díaz clan was arrested for this crime, but it was always suspected that there were more involved.
>
> “We still do not have a date but the case was brought to trial with a detainee; we believe there were three more involved. We asked that Maia Amaya , a trans girl who accompanied Cynthia and whom witnesses said they saw with her between February 14 and 15, be investigated; she denies that. We believe that she is trying to cover up something or for someone, ""said Laura Moreira. The young woman added that she does not believe that Amaya did that out of fear: “she never approached my family after the crime, nor did she accompany us on the marches; in fact she made fun of certain things, which made her an unloved person among trans girls. I think she is not lying out of fear but because she was involved”. Moreira considered that it is already known who the implicated were, and that she is waiting for their capture.

In September 2022 Ramón Soria was acquitted of her murder due to insufficient evidence.

Kimberlys had transitioned when she was 15.

> Yamileth [her mother] says that when it was 6:00 PM on Wednesday, Kimberlys sent her a message explaining that she was at the Passenger Terminal in Barquisimeto, and that she could not find a bus to go to Yaracuy.
> 
> “My daughter sent me a message that she was waiting for a bus, but he did not find any, I worried and told her I was going to wait, but my cell phone was discharged because she had taken the charger,” he said.
At dawn on Thursday she went to a neighbour’s house, borrowed the cell phone battery and received a text message from Blayerson sent at 9 o’clock on Wednesday evening.
> “Mom, I’m still in the terminal, I still do not get a taxi. I’m afraid because people look at me as if they want to hurt me, “the young woman wrote.
> 
> Without wasting time the lady got on a bus with her two-year-old daughter and arrived at the passenger terminal. Desperate she went to the bus stop that goes to Yaracuy but there they informed her that they did not know anything about her daughter.
> “As I did not have a ticket, I returned to Yaracuy, but on Friday morning my family supported me to look for her and we came to the hospital and found her in emergency,” she said.
