Raphaela was a social worker, hairdresser, and an important spokeswoman for LGBT causes in the southwest of the state. She worked at the Municipal Department of Social Development (Semdes) and taught hairdressing classes for women enrolled in the Bolsa Família program. She was also a member of the State Council for the Rights of the Population of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transvestite and Transgender (CELGBT), and coordinated the Finas Collective of transvestites and transsexuals.

Through social networks, throughout the day, the community LGBTQIA + of Bahia has expressed regret for the death of the activist.

Yesterday was Raphaela Souza and fear will not paralyze me, because I have to follow. But he's here. We have to be born every day. Re-elaborate. We lost a great woman in the history of Bahia. May Orun receive! The day Xango begins to charge every drop of blood, there will be no vessel to carry. ( Diego Pereira, via Facebook )

Travesti, from Vitória da Conquista, a human rights activist, a counselor from the Bahia State LGBT Council, had her life cut with three shots in her head!

Raphaela present! (Petra Peron, via Facebook)

This is the second murder of a trans woman in the city in a week. On 7th November two trans women were attacked near the Jadiel Matos Leste Ring Road.

Her neighbours called the police when they heard screams.

Upon arrival, the police found him escaping with some of Fanny's belongings and covered in her blood. He was arrested and confessed to the crime.

Fanny and the suspect had been living together for only a month when he killed her.

> ""It is not an exception to kill a trans at home or on the street, to be killed in the hands of a man who is usually a client or his partner,"" says a friend of the victim to the Uruguayan media Ecos. ""It is not something strange to our history, it seems to me that it should be considered as femicide, but it is something that Justice will determine,"" he added.

> According to her friend, when she was still a minor, she had no alternative other than to go into sex work. ""It has to do with the place that is assigned to us in this society within the possibilities and impossibilities, which makes you much more exposed to this kind of thing. Fanny lived in a difficult family context and had to live alone.""

On 7th March 2022 the man who had been her partner was sentenced to 24 years in prison for her transfemicide.

> Judge María Laura Sunhary sentenced the murderer of a 34-year-old trans woman, a crime perpetrated in 2018.
>
> On November 15, 2018, Fanny Aguiar, a 34-year-old trans woman, was murdered in Montevideo after being stabbed 50 times by her partner, a 21-year-old man.
>
> Aguiar's murderer was sentenced this Monday to 24 years in prison, in a historic ruling, since for the first time the Uruguayan justice recognized transfemicide as a crime, typifying the murder of a trans woman with an aggravating circumstance of hatred for her gender identity.

The defendant was sentenced on Wednesday (30) by the Judgment Council of the 3rd District Jury Court of Fortaleza.

> According to the MPCE, on the night of the crime, November 15, 2018, Flávia closed the salon, which worked at her house, and went in search of her partner, who was drinking in a bar and stayed with her in the establishment. After passing two other bars, they began to argue. Flávia was unhappy about the way Francisco lived, constantly drinking alcohol and drugs. After arguing, the two went home and then the waiter took a knife and stabbed the victim 17 times.
