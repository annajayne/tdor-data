> This day, the first crime of a trans woman is committed in Tierra del Fuego. This is Laura Aixa Xuxú Aguilar Millacahuin, 32, murdered in the building located at Rivadavia 418 in Río Grande. ""The perpetrator of the crime is her former partner, Carlos Humberto Traberg, 55, who is already held incommunicado at the disposal of Justice"" (Police Summary, 05-12-2013).
>
> The trans woman had been the first to obtain authorization to carry out the gender change, by registering her name that she had chosen on her birth certificate, on her DNI and on her work file.
>
> According to the site specializing in police issues, “the first version of the events that occurred indicates that Laura came to the house to talk. The man agreed, however after a few minutes the conversation escalated and they moved to the kitchen of the house, where the discussion got out of control. Traberg took a butcher-type knife, with which he made a cut on the left side of Laura's neck.""
>
> Traberg's elderly mother and a caregiver were in the house. This woman ""called the ambulance and the police, who were on the scene in a matter of minutes"" the medical professionals tried to save Laura Aguilar's life, but they could do nothing as the cut would have been in the area of the jugular.

Laura was well known for her advocacy for the rights of trans people.

> The woman had gained “public notoriety for her militancy in favor of the rights of the transsexual community. Along with having obtained her new DNI she established a close relationship with the work team of the government of Tierra del Fuego, which incorporated her into the Sewing Workshop of the Ministry of Social Development” (La 97 Radio Fueguina). 
>
> A few days before the crime, she had been “received by the governor (Fabiana) Ríos in the president’s office, where she presented her complaint against the directors of the Unified Provincial Autarchic Institute of Social Security (IPAUSS) for the delays in the completion of the sexual adaptation surgery that was being processed”.
>
> On the occasion, he declared: “There is a lot of anxiety, there is a lot of psychological and physical wear and tear,” Aguilar complained at that time, expressing that “I have updated my psychological and psychiatric reports and everything is approved, where two professionals expose the urgent nature surgery” (Radio Fueguina).

She died by suicide after being vilified by the tabloid press and continually hounded by reporters when news of her transition was made public.

At her inquest the coroner singled out the conduct of the Daily Mail in particular.

> The first and most visible consequence of “press interest” is the press pack turning up on your doorstep. They appeared, en masse, to besiege Lucy in her home. Reporters. Photographers. Camera crew. You name it.
> 
> I was spared. By lucky chance, I was not on the electoral register for the address I was living at. So the press never found me.
> 
> My parents, both pensioners, however, were fair game. We weren’t prepared for such media interest so we didn’t warn them and advise them to offer no comment. The press pack knocked at all hours. They pushed notes for me through their front door, offering money: asking for comment. And pictures. And an interview. Because I had moved just a few hundred yards away, I could see all this from my front window. I got into the habit of looking outside first to see if any journalists were hanging round, either sat waiting in their cars or, sometimes, just hanging around on the street corner. My son had to be picked up from the school office, 15 minutes after the home-time bell, just in case.
> 
> And if it was bad for me and my parents, I cannot imagine what it was like for Lucy. Shortly before the New Year, she was writing to others in the trans community for advice on how to deal with the press. She wrote about how she had to leave her house by the back door, and arrive at school very early, or late, to avoid the press pack. She spoke too of how the press offered other parents money for a picture of her. In the end, they simply lifted an old picture from the Facebook pages of her brother and sister without permission. Our wedding photo as well. A Year 5 drawing removed from her school’s website in an attempt to protect her was recovered when the press accessed it through caching. The Press Complaints Commission ruled that the wedding photo must be removed from the Mail Online, but once online, always online. Our private moment, for me and my family, put out there.
> 
>> ""I'd now ask for my privacy to be respected so that I can continue with my job,"" said Lucy Meadows, whose face has been in every national newspaper over the past week. Why? She transitioned from male to female and was a teacher – and was persecuted by the press after her local newspaper ran a ""story"" on those two facts.
>> 
>> Her emails show she was stalked by journalists: ""I'm just glad they didn't realise I also have a back door. I was usually in school before the press arrived and stayed until late so I could avoid them going home."" Parents were offered money for photos of her. It's a wonder she even got out of bed in the morning – I doubt I could, in her situation. Last week, she died.
> 
> Meadows's children, meanwhile, are grieving. They'll learn, though, of how she described a hostile press that turned away those parents who wanted to give positive comments. They'll know how Richard Littlejohn saw her life as nothing more than something to fill his column and suggested she just go away, presumably with a scarlet T emblazoned on her chest.
> 
> A petition calling for the Daily Mail to sack Littlejohn has, so far, more than 180,000 signatures. The Mail has dismissed the criticism as an ""organised Twitter campaign"", but wasn't this the same paper that whipped up signatures (a mere 39,000) calling for Jonathan Ross's sacking after Sachsgate? Paul Dacre will ignore the petition, of course, but he'd be a fool not to see how out-of-step the Mail is with fast changing public attitudes towards trans people.
> 
> There are plenty of trans teachers in Britain, quietly working away. If Littlejohn and pals want to ""protect"" children from trans people's existence, perhaps they should stop hounding us and putting us in their papers. They promise to, now, like wolves promising to self-regulate a hunt. As lawer and journalist David Allen Green says: ""The way the tabloids treated Lucy Meadows is how they would treat anyone, if they could get away with it.""

Lucy grew up with a strong Christian background, and the school where she worked appears to have been a faith school. Although her school and colleagues respected her, Lucy was the one who paid the price of the media's callous and cruel behaviour.
