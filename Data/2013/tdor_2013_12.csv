She had been shot in the head.

In October 2014 Delshawn Carroll, 20, pleaded guilty to her murder and was sentenced to 18 years to life in prison.

> While the motive for the shooting remains unclear, prosecutors said Carroll and Stergis had a past together.
>
> At first, Carroll denied being with Stergis the night of her death. But investigators found evidence that placed Carroll inside Stergis' car, prosecutors said.
>
> Cleveland police homicide detectives pulled touch DNA that matched Carroll's from Stergis' car door handle and a cigar wrapper found inside her car. Cellphone records showed Carroll called Stergis earlier that night, and his phone pinged from a nearby tower.
>
> Ballistics testing revealed that shell casings found inside Stergis' car matched a 9 mm Smith & Wesson handgun owned by one of Carroll's family members, prosecutors said.
