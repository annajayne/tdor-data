>
> *The victim has been identified by the Edmonton Police Service as Jon Syah Ribut.  However, she also used the names Rose, Rosa and Dido. In the Edmonton Journal, Paula Simons noted that  ""... it’s not clear whether Ribut saw himself as transgender -- or as a gay man who sometimes liked to cross-dress -- or as something else altogether...."" Although Simons (a journalist who is is trans-aware and trans-positive) uses male names and pronouns, it's clear that she's conflicted about it and knows that more information is needed. I will be using a female name and pronouns instead, but want to stress that both Simons and I are making a guess, and either of us could just as easily be wrong.*

> Rosa Ribut died of blunt force trauma, and 20-year-old Marcel Cristian Niculae has been charged in her death. There is no further information being given yet as to what happened or what the motive might have been.

> Ribut, 35, was an Indonesian citizen who came to Canada in 2012 under the Temporary Foreign Worker program. She had been working at a 7-Eleven in that capacity (presenting as male), but had also taken up working evenings as a female-presenting escort.

> SANTIAGO.- A trans woman of Peruvian origin was found dead yesterday night, inside a cité, in the center of Santiago. The incident occurred while the victim, nicknamed ""Jhendelyn"", was with two people in a room located on Coquimbo Street. According to police sources, those who were with her were other sex workers, who had injected silicone into her buttocks causing cardiorespiratory arrest. Afterwards her companions asked for help from neighbours, who tried to resuscitate her, but she had already died. Her body was referred to the Legal Medical Service (SML), where tests will be performed to determine if the liquid was actually injected and whether or not that was what caused her death.

Jhendelyn's death was not recorded on the official TDoR 2014 list released by Transgender Europe (TGEU).
