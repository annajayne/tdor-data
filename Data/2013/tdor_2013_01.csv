> Five men were charged Wednesday in the death of a Milwaukee rapper who went missing on New Year's Day and turned out to be the victim of a gruesome gang homicide, complaints say. Investigators were searching for the victim's body Wednesday at an area landfill. 
>
> The missing rapper is identified in the criminal complaint as [deadname], a [trans man]. The victim had previously been identified as Evon Young, 22, also known as Yung LT, during the public plea for information about his whereabouts.
>
> One of the defendants charged Wednesday told investigators he believed Young was a male, and other witnesses all referred to Young as a male. The charges, in two separate complaints, do not suggest in any way that Young's transgendered status played any role in the defendants' motivation for the attack.
>
> Young's mother first reported Young missing on Jan. 2 after Young failed to show up at his job or a meeting with his mother and couldn't be reached. His roommate to>ld police that Young had gone outside their house near N. 52nd St. and W. Custer Ave. about 10:30 p.m. Jan. 1, got in a car and never came back.
>
> Young's family spread fliers about his disappearance and went on television seeking help in finding him. Two other young men also had disappeared earlier New Year's Day - downtown and in Cedarburg - after drinking with friends.
>
> Milwaukee police detectives working several angles quickly began to put the lie to Young's roommate's story.
>
> Young's mother had found a cellphone near where the roommate said Young had gotten in a car, and the last call made on it was Jan. 1. About a week later, she turned it over to police, who traced it to Victor Stewart and Ashanti Mcalister. Stewart was a suspect in the theft of his wife's car, an Impala like the one a witness had seen idling near Young's house the night of Jan. 1.
> 
> But Stewart's wife later admitted she had lied about the car being stolen because she was angry that Stewart took it on Jan. 1 and didn't return until about 6 a.m. Jan. 2, causing her to miss work. When he did come back, the car smelled strongly of bleach. A bottle of bleach was inside the car, and she placed it under her sink at home. Police later found Stewart's fingerprint in the car, on the bleach bottle and a piece of duct tape recovered from the basement where Young was killed.
>
> Young's roommate, Billy R. Griffin, 26, had initially told police that Young got into a car with someone on Jan. 1 and never returned. But in the complaint, he admits that Stewart, 27, Mcalister, 19, Ron Joseph Allen, 37, and Devin Lattrez Seaberry, 23, members of a street gang, had come to his house and said Young could not be trusted. They told Griffin he would be readmitted to the gang if he killed Young.
>
> Instead, the complaints say, the others took Young to the basement, choked Young with a chain and taped a plastic bag over Young's head while Mcalister held a gun. After Young passed out, the group beat Young with tools. Griffin said he couldn't take watching and returned upstairs but later heard the others say they wanted to make sure Young was dead, then three gunshots.
>
> The group later cleaned his basement with bleach, he told police, rolled Young's body up in a sheet and took it to Stewart's car, then to a trash bin at 8100 N. 84th St.

Evon was a rapper who music to his ReverbNation account at https://www.reverbnation.com/yunglt. His body was never found.

Of the five who killed him, Allen and Mcalister were both sentenced to life, Griffin to 7 1/2 years and Seaberry to 8 years. Stewart and Seaberry both accepted plea deals.

> Cleveland, January 2013 and 20-year-old Cemia “Ce Ce” Dove went out in the morning and was never seen alive again.
> 
> The same day two men called on local man Andrew Bridges looking for rent he owed. They noticed there was blood splattered in the house, a bonfire burning in the back yard and his hand was bleeding badly.
> 
> However, it was three months before police found Dove’s body in Bridges’s pond. She’d been stabbed 40 times and her body weighted with a lump of concrete.
> 
> 36-year-old Bridges had called Dove in the morning of the murder and paid $100 for a cab to bring her up to his house.
> 
> Exactly what happened is unknown but detectives think that when Bridges found out that Dove was [a trans woman], he became very angry and killed her.

Bridges was found guilty in November of the same year and sentenced to life in prison.

> “Justice was done,” said the victim’s mother, Martha Acoff. “My [daughter] is with me in spirit. Andrey Bridges is going to get what he deserves. He’s going to have to ask God for His forgiveness. I forgive him.”

When they discovered that she was not a cisgender woman, they killed her.

> The 20-year-old [trans woman] [deadname] Generoso, also known as “Nicole Galisteu”, was murdered last Sunday (5) in the Santa Cândida neighborhood after the men who were meeting her discovered that Galisteu was not a [cisgender] woman. The information was passed by the Homicide Police of Curitiba (DH) on Tuesday (8). According to the expert, three suspects of involvement in the crime were arrested and despite claiming to be innocent the evidence confirms their participation.
>
> “They went out in a club and two of their friends started making fun of one of them by saying they were kissing a man. When they saw that he really was a transvestite, they took the gun from the house and killed Bruno Galisteu because of this, ”said Chief Officer Rubens Recalcatti of DH.

> One of them became interested in Nicole; The two of them exchanged kisses, but a macho man noticed she was [transgender]. At this point, the (usual) game that allows the perpetuation of male domination began. Rather than drawing the straight-male friend's attention to the fact that he was interested in a [trans woman], the pack took a step in restoring his ""softness."" There is nothing wrong with a straight man being attracted to a trans woman, wanting and kissing her. Male chauvinistic codes of conduct, however, require men who claim the label of heterosexuality to be ready to do anything, to commit any brutality or insanity to prove their masculinity.
>
> Anything at all, even premeditating murder, as Nicole's murderers did. Two of them went home for a weapon while the third distracted the [trans woman] and ensured that she would not leave the club. When they returned, they continued to act as if nothing had happened and offered to take her home, on the way they got her out of the car, shot 7 times at her, then drove the car over her body. The press boasted that Nicole was murdered because she was ""mistaken for a woman."" Almost a defense of the ""prerogative"" of male domination to ""wash honor with blood"" when ""deceived"". Cheap terrorism to intimidate [trans women], so they are afraid of exactly what they are: women.

According to one of her relatives the victim knew her murderers and that they were clients.

Activists from the NGO Society Against Sexual Orientation Discrimination (SASOD) noted that  violence against transgender sex workers is way too common in Guyana, underscoring that many incidents go unreported because the victims fear that no action will be taken against the perpetrators  and added “laws which criminalise crossH dressing and sameHsex intimacy provide institutional validation for the prejudices which fuel violence against sexual and gender minorities.”
