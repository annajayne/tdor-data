> Kaos GL and Pink Life LGBTT Associations in Ankara declared a statement against government’s reluctance to tackle transphobic violence at large and criticized the fact that murderers of trans people are either not found or judged with minimum punishments due to the concept of “unjust provocation” in the Turkish legal system.

> Buse Kiliçkaya, a trans activist from Pink Life LGBTT Association, stated that everyone should develop a sensitivity towards trans murders. Kiliçkaya also pointed at a parallel between Gezi Park protests and trans struggle, saying that “the resistance is no different.”
 
In social media, LGBT activists criticize mainstream media’s insistence on publishing trans people’s identity names, not the ones they actually use.

He then dismembered her and dumped her body parts in a vacant lot in the Strawberry Mansion section of Philadelphia.

Sargent was convicted of her murder in March 2018 and jailed for life.

> Friends and family of Diamond Williams, a transgender woman in the Strawberry Mansion area of Philadelphia, gathered last night at Love Park for a Vigil and Speak Out held in her honor.  
> 
> According to GLAAD, speakers at the event included: Christian Axvaier Lovehall of Philly Trans* March, Samantha Jo Dato of Mazzoni Center’s Trans* Wellness Project, Aamina Morrison, Co-director of Trans-health Information Program (TIP), Sade Ali of Philadelphia Deputy Commissioner Department of Behavioral Health and Intellectual Disability Services, and Gloria Casarez, Director of LGBT Affairs at the Mayor’s Office, among others.
> 
> Rachel Rose remembers Diamond Williams as a person with a big personality and an even bigger heart.
> 
> ""She was so full of life. She was funny and we used to laugh. And I remember just acting silly with her and I just miss her because we had a lot of great times,"" Rose said.
> 
> “She was a very loving, caring, and creative person. We were family. We were like sisters and she loved her sisters. No one should ever have to die the way she died.”
> 
> Following Williams’ murder last week, media coverage of the crime generated an immense backlash among activists and members of the queer community. The repeated misgendering of Williams and perceived victim-blaming by numerous news outlets sent familiar shockwaves through these communities, as well as initiated a formal response by GLAAD.
> 
> In light of these facts, GALAEI Executive Director Elicia Gonzales released this statement surrounding last night’s vigil: “We are sad and outraged — saddened at the loss of yet another transwoman in Philadelphia, and outraged by the insensitive, inaccurate, and transphobic reporting by local police and media. Tonight we unite to honor the life of Diamond and to demand justice and respect for all members of our brave and resilient community.”

> MONTEGO BAY, Jamaica (AP) — Dwayne Jones was relentlessly teased in high school for being effeminate until he dropped out. His father not only kicked him out of the house at the age of 14 but also helped jeering neighbors push the youngster from the rough Jamaican slum where he grew up.

> ""Savana was on the point with other girls when the suspect known as Tiny arrived. As soon as the car stopped, Savannah approached thinking her was a customer, but he did not say anything and fired. One shot hit her face and the other hit the arm of India, who was behind her,"" said Maria Laura. 
> 
> The other [trans woman] working on the spot called the police and the Mobile Emergency Care Service (Samu). According to the president, the motivation for the crime was a debt that the suspect had with India.

She had been beaten.

Andrea was of Colombian descent. In a video interview made several days before her murder, she stated that the Termini Station was her home, but that she was afraid and didn't feel safe there.

> Andrea says she left Colombia to try her luck in Italy. However, the impact on her of Rome and the station was devastating. After being robbed several times, the young woman had a paralysed arm and a bad leg. Just that leg and the limp with which she dragged herself made her particularly recognisable to the people of Termini. Her paralyzed arm and injured leg were the result of an assault which ended with the theft of her phone and passport: ""In Ostia a boy hit me, I was seven months in a coma"". Also for this reason his dream was to ""meet a guy with a lot of money that makes me leave the road because it is too ugly"".
> 
> Maria Gabriella Lanza, the journalist who collected her story, described Andrea as follows: ""While smiling in front of the camera and asking laughing if it was good footage, Andrea did not think about death....she did not expect to die a few days later wearing her pink skirt and her sneakers. She thought of the future - because in spite of everything she had not lost hope. ""I would like to meet a guy with a lot of money that will help me leave the road because it's too ugly"", she told us. A sad smile, her story, her life, today [at her funeral] there were only two or three homeless people from the station, her traveling companions and nobody else"".
