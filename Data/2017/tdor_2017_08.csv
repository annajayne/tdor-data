The weapon used to kill her was found near her body.

In December 2018 Cícero Pereira dos Santos was sentenced to 14 years for her murder.

According to court records, Mary had slapped Cicero after he allegedly harassed her. After the incident, she was pursued by dos Santos and his stepson, Leandro Batista de Souza before being stabbed several times.

> The Public Prosecutor requests the conviction of Cícero Pereira dos Santos for double-qualified homicide, with the qualifiers of futile motive and use of torture in the practice of crime. The defendant's defense, in the final allegations, maintained that he committed the act ""under the effect of violent emotion, losing control of his emotional and psychological faculties as a result of the aggressions suffered previously by the quarrels with the victim.""

Despite confessing to using her for money and sex and shooting her, he was acquitted after using a form of trans panic defence.

> Local media never stopped misgendering trans woman Jaylow Mcglory from the day she was killed in cold blood to the day Desmond Donte Harris was acquitted. Harris who was initially charged with murder [in] the First degree was the only witness the defense called to testify. Harris was found not guilty by a jury of second-degree murder in 2019 by using a version of the reviled and discredited trans panic defense.
> 
> Harris and McGlory had just moved into a duplex on Monroe Street about a week before the shooting took place, according to the landlord at the property, as well as a neighbor. That neighbor, Latasha Forte, said in just a brief amount of time, she frequently heard the two arguing. During the day of the shooting, Forte told the court that she heard Harris and McGlory arguing and then heard “two pops” and didn’t think anything of it at first, that’s until a bloody McGlory showed up to her door telling her to call the police. McGlory, who never identified the shooter, died before first responders could get there.
> 
> Detectives with the Alexandria Police Department told the court that they recovered two bullets, as McGlory was shot two times, and three bullet casings. A weapon was never found. Shortly before the shooting, Harris placed a call to his landlord, upset, and told her, “He said I want her to leave. I wasn’t sure who ‘her’ was. I said the best course of action was to call the police.” After the shooting, investigators “pinged” Harris’s cellphone and tracked him down to his sister’s home on Irish Lane where was hiding in a closet. He requested an attorney immediately and never spoke to the police.
> 
> On the second and final day of testimony Harris testified that he had walked out of a bathroom to find McGlory with a gun. He said the two fought over it, that it fired three times — hitting McGlory twice — and then he ran away.
> 
> Prosecutors asked Harris about the jail conversation that inmate Brandon Wade Clark had testified about for the prosecution on Wednesday. Clark said Harris had confessed during a conversation with him and other inmates to using McGlory for money and sex and shooting [her]. Harris then said Mcglory had the gun in her possession as they struggled but laid it down next to him when she was fatally wounded. The gun has never been recovered.

Jaylow's murder did not come to light until November 2017 and was not recorded on the official TDoR 2017 list released by Transgender Europe (TGEU) the same month.

She had died from asphyxiation.

> Two employees of the club, located in the 9 de Julio Park in the provincial capital, found her under the southern tribune of Lawn Tennis. They hung up advertising posters, before a rugby match, when they found her body. Ayelén lay naked.
>
> The local press spoke first of ""a person"" murdered and then ""a travesti."" After a few hours and after identification of the body by her mother it was learned that the victim was Ayelén Gómez, a trans woman from Ranchillos, a commune 24 km from San Miguel de Tucumán.
>
> In that same city, on April 19, 2012, she had been arrested, raped and abused by two policemen from the second section of San Miguel. Ayelén had denounced these events in an interview as soon as [she] regained [her] freedom.

On the third anniversary of her death Ayelén's sister Yohana published an open letter calling for justice.

> Open letter from Ayelén Gómez's sister, 3 years after her Transfemicide:
>
> Hello, my name is Yohana Gómez, I am the sister of Ayelén Gómez, a young trans girl who was murdered on August 12, 2017 in the vicinity of the Lawn tennis stands in the 9 de Julio park.  Today 3 years after her brutal murder I want to remember the request for justice for her crime.
>
> I also want to remember and tell you a bit about Ayelén. She was a girl, and a fighter throughout her life history, it was not easy for her from a very young age. She lived through very difficult times and had a domestic accident where she was left with a disability in her hand.
>
> Later in her teens, she went through discrimination on many occasions not being able to have the opportunity to have a good job, the only job she could go to was selling cosmetics, and she also liked to sew and made her own clothes. She also made them us for us, her siblings.
>
> She liked playing with the boys very much and was very affectionate, always looking out for her family. She always took good care of her younger siblings and that is one of the things that I remember the most, so I will always be involved in the fight to demand justice. Lisa - that's what we called her in the family - I tell you that we miss her so much today. It is the third year without her and how it hurts to know there will be many more. I believe that the only consolation to alleviate so much pain is that justice is done for Ayelén Gómez's femicide. Let the true culprits pay, today I am missing a very large part in my life, my LISA, my sister.
>
> Only in dreams she visits me, can I see her and hug her, I miss her a lot,  that is why I ask for solidarity with the trans girls who continue in their fight for a dignified and peaceful life. That they are respected. To the families, they want them to help them because they don't exist like them. Today it's my turn to live without my sister, some murderers took her from me, who by their decision ended her life and they have no idea of ​​the damage they did, the pain they left behind.
>
> 3 years without Ayelén Gómez but you will always be here now and always justice for Ayelén”.

On 30th November 2020 a permanent memorial to Ayelén was erected near the club on Gobernador del Campo Avenue in the form of a red bench: 

> Next Monday, the Municipality of San Miguel de Tucumán will inaugurate a red bench to pay tribute to Ayelén Gómez, a young trans woman who was found murdered on August 12, 2017 near the stands of the Tucuman Lawn Tennis Club, in Parque 9 de July.""
>
> As reported by the Municipality, the ceremony will take place at 10.30, on Gobernador del Campo Avenue, near the club. Municipal officials and family members of Ayelén will participate. 
>
> The event is part of the public policies carried out by the municipality to raise awareness and make femicides visible, and of the activities organized by the ""International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women"", which was commemorated on November 25. 

In September 2021  Adrián Miranda admitted Ayelén's murder, and was sentenced to 12 years in prison for ""simple homicide"" (the judge refused to consider the charge of  transfemicide). However, he may not have acted alone - and if that was the case the other alleged perpetrators remain at large.

> There were four years of waiting until today when a conviction was finally achieved for the transfemicide of Ayelén Gómez that occurred in August 2017.
>
> In a short trial, Adrián Miranda, the only defendant in the crime, admitted having murdered Ayelén and reached a deal the prosecution which established a sentence of 12 years in prison.
>
> “We consider that the investigation was really flawed. The DNA test gives unknown perpetrators and we have the hypothesis that Miranda acted with someone else,” said Martín González, a lawyer for the human rights organization ANDHES, who acted as plaintiffs in the case.

In a final insult, the ruling by the judge deadnamed Ayelén.
