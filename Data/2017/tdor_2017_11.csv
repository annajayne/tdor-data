> Sometime early this morning, a Vietnamese American Seattle woman named Natalie Nguyen apparently committed suicide by stepping out in front of an oncoming car. She was 22.

> I never knew her IRL name until this happened; I knew her only as Tipsy Tentacle, a well-liked (and much-loved by many) member of the Mastodon community.
> 
> She was reportedly experiencing a lot of emotional pain related to her transition. She was at a party with some friends (some of them also Mastodon people, and at least one of them being someone I’d consider friend-material if I knew her a little better — so not clods; real, supportive people) and apparently that pain just overcame her at some point. (Clarification: As far as I know, harassment wasn’t a factor here; I mainly (vaguely) remember her talking about dysphoria and being misgendered… and being breathlessly delighted when gendered correctly, like ‘did I even hear that correctly?’ I know that feeling so well.)
> 
> She left the party saying she was going for a walk. She left a suicide post on Mastodon. And then the police were handing her stuff to the friend, saying “I’m sorry for your loss”.
> 
> The news is reporting it as a hit-and-run… and also misgendered her initially, but enough Mastodonians yelled at them that they’ve corrected that error.

A 35 year old suspect has been arrested. He is also accused of stabbing a Moroccan man to death 12 hours later.

A statement from MozaiQ (https://www.facebook.com/mozaiqromania/) said:

> ""We would like to stop and remember Laura, a Romanian woman who worked in Italy, recently killed in a attack. Every year we remember that people still are victims of violence, even in Europe. Italy has one of the most serious statistics on violence against persons. It is important to make our voices heard, to go public against such horrible crimes.
> 
> ""With each act of violence is a system of oppression of persons. It is our duty to stress that there are still problems in our societies. In Romania, the people have fewer opportunities to succeed in life because the transition process is extremely long and humiliating, access to healthcare is restricted, while access to the labour market remains a problem. We are with our brothers and sisters. Laura's death will not be in vain, because we will always have her memory in our hearts.""

On 21st December 2017, white supremacist Brandon Michael Tyson, 31, was arrested and charged with her murder.

> Her family told KFOR that they are “heartbroken.”
> 
> “Brooklyn BreYanna was an amazing daughter, sister and friend with a giving and loving heart,” said the family, who have started a GoFundMe account so that they can bury their loved one. “We pray that those who committed this heinous crime will be identified and Brooklyn will receive justice.”

Tyson was convicted in February 2019 and imprisoned for life in April 2019.

> “Burying a child is nothing that a parent should have to do,” Stevenson’s mother Vivian said, as she addressed Tyson at the hearing. “So with that being said, I never wanted the death penalty for you because I did not want your parents to have to go through what I am having to endure. I do pray that you get life without parole, though, because you have proven by your actions that you do not deserve to be free ever again.”
> 
> Stevenson’s sister Leslie added: “The impact of Brooklyn’s murder has completely and dramatically changed our lives forever. Even though whatever happens today won’t bring Brooklyn back, at least our family can start to heal knowing her death was not in vain and her accused murderer will spend the rest of his life in prison where killers belong.”

According to Júlia’s boyfriend she worked with online e-commerce, but had traveled to Florianópolis to raise money through sex work to fulfill her dream of moving to Italy. She had already been deported by from Italy once after an agency let her down and was working to raise money to return.

Júlia had come out as trans at the age of 12, and began her transition at 15. Like many trans women in Brazil she still had documentation in her birth name, but had started the process of correcting this with the help of a lawyer. Unlike many, she had the full support of her family.

Earlier in 2017 Júlia had participated in the trans beauty contest Miss T Brazil, as part of which she had been interviewed:

Her aunt said the family knew that Júlia did sex work to raise money, but for fear of violence had asked her not to travel to Florianopolis.
