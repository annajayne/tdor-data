Kenneth Bostick,59,,2017_05_04_Kenneth-Bostick.jpg,,4-May-2017,tgeu/4-May-2017/Kenneth Bostick,,,New York,New York,USA,40.713054,-74.007228,violence,beaten,"Kenneth lived in a homeless shelter and was beaten on the head with a metal pipe. He spent more than a week in Bellevue Hospital before he died on 4th May.

> Bostick also used to talk about finding permanent housing, and he had plans for that, too. “He wanted a big apartment,” the social worker said, and when he got it someday, his plan was to have a dinner party. He’d invite a bunch of friends and serve them a big catered spread. “But then he’d make people believe that he cooked the food himself. He laughed when he said that. He knew it was a little rascally.”

Initial news reports about his murder misgendered Kenneth and referred to him by his deadname.

> **We Got It Wrong**

> UPDATE: Initial reports incorrectly identified Kenneth Bostick as a transgender woman. We have updated this story to indicate he was a trans man.
> 
> When a crime happens—especially a violent crime—details can be sparse, and the media can rush to get the story out before getting it right.
> 
> Last week we reported on the death of Kenneth Bostick, believed to be the tenth trans person murdered in the U.S. so far this year. Working on early news reports, we misgendered Kenneth as a trans woman. In subsequent days, friends have stepped forward to give a more accurate representation of his identity.
> 
> While our mistake was made without malice, it was a mistake nonetheless. Too many times crimes against transgender people are misreported and their identities are erased. Sometimes that’s out of ignorance, but too often it’s because family members don’t want to be “embarrassed” or authorities don’t want to acknowledge the epidemic of anti-trans violence. One in four trans people has faced a bias-driven assault in this country, and 2016 saw more murders of trans people than any other.
> 
> But it’s also about shaping a narrative: We, like most outlets, reported that Bostick’s death was the tenth murder of a trans woman of color in 2017. While it’s important to acknowledge that, it also drives a narrative about who is at risk and who needs help. Shelters and other social services are often divided by gender—a trans man housed with cisgender men faces serious threats to their safety and well-being. And that shouldn’t be ignored, either.
> 
> And lastly, it’s about human beings: It’s easy to boil a person down to the particulars of their death, to paint them as just another victim. Especially if they’re not on Facebook or don’t have dozens of selfies on Instagram.

> This is a memorial for Sherrell Faulkner, a 46-year old woman from Charlotte, North Carolina, who deserves to be remembered as fully human, and not merely as a headline. It goes almost without saying that Ms. Faulkner’s death is one in a tragic continuum of black trans women who are victimized, brutalized, and murdered just for their very existence. It needs to be said, however, that Sherrell Faulkner’s life is worth specific recognition and celebration. In every way that her death is systematic, it is also deeply individual, and should be treated as such.  
> 
> When we only see Sherrell Faulkner as one name in a much-too-long list of transgender victims, we dehumanize her in a means that is ideologically similar to her aggressor(s). For this reason, we won’t to re-iterate the specifics of her death, since too many pieces focus only on them (we have linked some of these throughout.) Instead, we want to take a moment to talk about the Southern context of her death, and most importantly, the specifics of her life, which deserves its own context and recognition. Her death is both part of a national epidemic and a Charlotte-specific tragedy; it is simultaneously a community-wide trial and an individual tribulation for her loved ones.

Sadly and crying a lot, she commented that Sheila always went to Nossa Senhora D’Ajuda Church with her to pray, and that she was a very dear person for all who only did good.

Leo Etherington,15,,2017_05_31_Leo-Etherington.jpg,https://www.bucksfreepress.co.uk/news/15506437.Transgender_teenager_found_dead_in_bedroom__struggled_with_gender_identity_issues___inquest_hears/,31-May-2017,,,,High Wycombe,Buckinghamshire,United Kingdom,51.627422,-0.748415,suicide,suicide,"Leo died by suicide. His school had refused to use his new name even though he had transitioned the year before.

> Leo Etherington had come out at home and at school – but teachers at Wycombe high school, an all-girls grammar school, told the 15-year-old that he could not change his name on the register for another year.
> 
> Giving evidence at an inquest into his son’s death, Martin Etherington said: “The school told him he had to be 16 to change his name. He said he was angry with the school.
> 
> “I asked him if I should speak to them and he said no. I said we could wait until he was 16 and then change his name.”
> 
> The student had also been told by the family GP that he would not be eligible for gender reassignment surgery on the NHS. In his evidence his father said: “I told Leo I would fund any surgery when the time came.”
> 
> The family thought Leo was studying for forthcoming GCSE exams in his room on the afternoon of his death on 31 May. But his father found his body in his room after he missed calls to come down to dinner.

> Mr Etherington added: “The school told him he had to be 16 to change his name. He said 

The tragedy is that both the school and his GP were incorrect - there was no reason the school could not have respected his identity, and the NHS can fund testosterone therapy for trans men from age 16 onwards, and surgery from 18.

Leo's death was not included on the official TGEU TDoR 2017 list.
