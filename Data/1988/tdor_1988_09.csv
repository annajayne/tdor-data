"Pamela Leigh Walton (""Julie Doe"")",25,,1988_09_25_Pamela-Walton.jpg,https://dnadoeproject.org/case/transgender-julie-doe/,25-Sep-1988,,Highway 474,Green Swamp,"Clermont, Florida",,USA,28.37918342,-81.75776449,violence,beaten,"Pamela's remains were found in Lake County on 25th September, 1988. She was finally identified by the DNA Doe project in early 2025.

> On 25 September 1988, a person looking for cypress wood in the Green Swamp area discovered the body of Julie Doe in the vicinity of Highway 474, four miles east of Highway 33 west of Orlando, FL — near the town of Clermont in Lake County.
> 
> Julie was white, age 22 to 35, about 5'10, 170 pounds, with naturally brown hair. She had on a blue-green tank top, acid-washed denim skirt (label Manisha), and pantyhose.
> 
> A 1988 autopsy indicated that Julie Doe had prior injuries consistent with a broken rib, cheekbone, and nose. The autopsy also mistakenly determined Julie was a cisgender woman who had previously given birth. Later DNA analysis determined the victim had an XY genotype and was a transgender woman.

> Her initial autopsy in 1988 discovered she had healed fractures of her cheekbone and nose, along with a rib. She had breast implants that dated from before 1985. This autopsy concluded that she was female, and had given birth to at least one child. Later DNA testing revealed that she had been [assigned male at birth], with both X and Y chromosomes. 
>
> In 2019, the Lake County Sheriff’s Office reached out to the DNA Doe Project to try a novel technique – investigative genetic genealogy – to find her identity. They connected with volunteers who were also part of an initiative called the Trans Doe Task Force, who began the work on the case before leaving to focus full time on that group.  It would take five years of diligence and persistence by a team of expert volunteers to narrow Pamela’s family tree to the correct branch to find her name. 
>
> “The team faced just about every possible hurdle, from unknown parentage, matches who were adopted, to endogamy,” said team co-leader Eric Hendershott. “Even up to the end, when we suspected that she was adopted, the team was stuck.”
>
> Adoption records are not accessible to genetic genealogists, and adoption presents a brick wall to investigators because the child is often removed from their community of birth and their name is changed. Pamela had been adopted at the age of 5, which left a few breadcrumbs for researchers to follow.
>
> “It was clear from the start that our Doe had strong family ties to Kentucky, but we didn’t know for sure if she was born there or if she ever lived there,” said Lance Daly, investigative genetic genealogist. “While searching Fayette County records, we discovered the names of two key relatives who were crucial to unraveling the mystery.”
>
> Pamela had grown up with her adopted family in Kentucky, and had officially changed her name before she was in her mid-20s, likely around the time she underwent sex reassignment surgery and therapy. 
>
> “Pamela’s story includes many common themes that trans people face,” said Pam Lauritzen, Executive Director of Media and Communications. “From derogatory notations left in high school yearbooks about her to a headstone pre-carved with her former male name, it’s heartbreaking to know that the community was not willing to accept her and the identity she chose.”
>
> In 2024, DNA Doe Project conducted a media outreach campaign to try to get tips from the public who might have known the then Julie Doe. Facebook posts boosted into Kentucky and Florida received multiple reports as “misleading” and “spam”, causing Meta to remove the posts and cancel the ads before they could run. After review, the posts were reinstated, only to be removed again after a few hours. 
>
> “This went on for weeks,” Lauritzen explained. “The support person acknowledged that it was because we were boosting a transgender case into places where anti-trans sentiment runs high. Eventually, Meta just stopped responding to my requests for review.”
>
> Julie Doe’s story was featured in a handful of publications, but in the end it was genealogy research that resolved the case. 
>
> “Pamela Walton’s identification is the result of over five years of work by nearly 50 volunteers,” said Emily Bill, investigative genetic genealogist. “Their efforts laid the foundation for a series of recent discoveries that finally led us to her name.”
>
> The DNA Doe Project is grateful to the groups and individuals who helped solve this case: the Lake County Sheriff’s Office, who entrusted the case to the DNA Doe Project; The Trans Doe Taskforce for bringing the case to DDP; University of North Texas Center for Human Identification for extraction of DNA and sample prep for whole-genome sequencing; HudsonAlpha Discovery for sequencing; Greg Magoon for bioinformatics; GEDmatch Pro and FTDNA for providing their databases; our generous donors who joined our mission and contributed to this case; and DDP’s dedicated teams of volunteer investigative genetic genealogists who work tirelessly to bring all our Jane and John Does home.
