> Cam Lyman was a wealthy dog trainer who had lived in a male role for some time. Lyman was reported missing in July 1987, and his bones were found 10 years later, September 24, 1997, in the septic tank of his home.
> 
> There had been signs of struggle at Lyman’s home. Police labeled it murder.
> 
> George O'Neil is the prime suspect in the disappearance and death of Cam. His actions prior to and following the disappearance were extremely suspicious. He never reported Cam missing or told his family about the disappearance. He also became Cam's sole beneficiary and would inherit the estate. After his disappearance, O'Neil began showing Cam's dogs as his own. He also cashed Cam's checks and kept the money for himself. Finally, he refused to let investigators search the Lyman property, where Cam's remains would later be found.
