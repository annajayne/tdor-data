She bled to death on a sidewalk after being shot.

> [Diane] Carter, barefoot and wearing a woman's red-checkered winter coat some nuns had just given [her], bled to death on a sidewalk at South Station.
>
> ...Probably the most notorious and, some would argue, irritating [trans woman] in Boston for two decades, Carter was known to hundreds of Bay Village and South End residents who listened to [her] constant stream of abuse, police officers who broomed and arrested [her] and nuns and social workers who helped [her] survive.
>
> Since [she] was in [her] late teens, police knew [her] to wear a matted wig and dress as a woman. Carter was one of the more widely known street persons in the city. [[2]]

The lack of care the city and the callous way the Boston Globe wrote about her above contrasts markedly with the compassion showed by her to the nuns who had fed and clothed her.

> [Diane] Carter, a [trans woman] and street person who was shot and killed Sept. 16, was buried Wednesday [1st October] in St. Joseph's Cemetery, West Roxbury. Carter, 36, was found mortally wounded across from South Station. Police are still searching for [her] slayer. Carter's body had lain unclaimed for two weeks before [her] family learned last week of her] death. The victim was buried following a service at Bullock's Funeral Home.
>
> ""It was a beautiful funeral,"" said Sister Josephine Dullaghan, a nun at Emmanuel House in the South End, where the sisters had fed and clothed Carter for years. Carter's parents, three sisters and one brother attended the service. Those who know the victim's family said they had tried for years to help Carter. ""[Diane] was an adult and there was not much they could do,"" said one family friend. ""When [she] was on the street there were shelters, but the type of psychological help [she] needed is not out there."" [[4]]
