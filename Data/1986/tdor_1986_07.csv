> Little information is available about Live Oak Doe, who was killed on July 10, 1986, in South Houston, Texas. It is apparent from details that this Doe was transgender or gender-variant. The Trans Doe Task Force has been attempting to research this case in hopes of putting in a recommendation for forensic genealogical analysis by the DNA Doe Project.

Wikipedia has this to say about her:

> A black subject, 20 to 30 years old, who was likely a trans woman or a drag queen, was pronounced dead after being transported to a hospital when found unresponsive on July 10, 1986, in Live Oak, Harris County, Texas. The cause of death was strangulation, which may have been done with pantyhose. The subject was dressed in pink pants, a gray shirt, and a black belt with spikes. A pair of socks was under the shirt, likely used to mimic breasts. A heart tattoo containing a scroll was on one arm, and the victim's fingernails had been painted gold at one point. Four earrings were found in each ear; a ring with a clear stone, a ring without a stone, a silver chain, and two gold-colored necklaces were also found. The victim may have had a drug history, as needle marks were visible on the arms.
