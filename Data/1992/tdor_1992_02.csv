Jessy Santiago,30,,,,8-Feb-1992,tdor.info/8 Feb 1992/Unknown Transvestite Prostitute and tdor.info/18 Feb 1992/Jessy Santiago,,South Bronx,New York City,New York,USA,40.9075,-73.89656,violence,beaten and stabbed,"Jessy was stabbed with a screwdriver and beaten with a pipe by Augustin Rosado after he discovered that she was trans. He then killed himself.

> A bizarre case of mistaken sexual identity ended in the fatal screwdriver stabbing of a Bronx [trans sex worker] and the suicide of [her]s killer early yesterday, police said. It began late Friday night when 47-year-old Augustin Rosado propositioned what he believed was a female [sex worker] in the University Heights section. The two headed to Rosado's fourth-floor furnished room in a transient hotel on Cresten Avenue, police said. Once inside, Rosado discovered the prostitute was a [trans sex worker] and flew into a rage, stabbing the unidentified 30-year-old [woman] repeatedly with a screwdriver and hitting [her] with a metal pipe, police said.... A detective working on the case said it is nearly impossible to tell on sight which [sex workers] ply ing their trade in the area are [trans] and which are [cisgender]. ""Some of these [trans women] look sexier than some women,"" he said. ""I could see how someone could be surprised."" (Jamieson 1992) 

Tragically Jessy's younger sister Peggy (who was also trans) had also been murdered three years earlier.

> No one writes about the names we cannot forget, names we still hear in the night-like Christian Paige, a young woman who moved to Chicago to earn money for surgery and ended up brutally beaten, strangled, and then stabbed in the chest and breasts so many times that her family at first thought her body had been intentionally mutilated. We don t hear about Marsha P. Johnson (drowned), Richard Goldman (shot by his father for crossdressing), Harold Draper (multiple stab wounds), Cameron Tanner (beaten to death with baseball bats), Mary S. (fished out of the trunk of her car-beaten, stabbed, and drowned), Chanelle Pickett (strangled), Brandon Teena (raped, beaten, stabbed, and shot), Deborah Forte (strangled and stabbed), Jessy Santiago (beaten, repeatedly stabbed with box cutter, screwdriver, and knife), or her younger sister, Peggy, also transgendered, who was killed just three years earlier.
