> PATERSON - The Passaic County Prosecutor's Office said yesterday that the body of a [trans woman] found stabbed 25 times in West Paterson has been identified as [deadname] Draper, a homeless city [woman] with a record of prostitution and drug offenses.
>
> Assistant Prosecutor William J. Purdy Jr. said the identification process was slowed because no dental records were turned up for the badly decomposed body found May 30 off Rifle Camp Road. The decomposition of the body made it impossible to match finger prints, Purdy said.
>
> County Investigator Harold C. Pegg Jr. said Draper was last seen alive on April 17 at about 9 p.m. getting into car on Cianci Street. He said Draper was reported missing the following Friday, April 24, by a family member.
>
> Pegg said although Draper was living on the street, [she] worked for St. Philips Ministry on North First Street and got [her] clothes there.
>
> He said the clothing and the jewelry found on the body have been identified as belonging to Draper. The body was found wearing a bra stuffed with socks, a sheepskin jacket, leg warmers, and western-style boots. An earring was found under the body and a bracelet was recovered from one arm.
>
> Pegg said it is believed that Draper was stabbed in the secluded area behind St. Ann's Melkite Catholic Church in West Paterson where the body was found.
>
> Anyone with further information about Draper is being asked to call Pegg at 881-4800 or West Paterson Detective Lt. Thomas Hemsey at 345-8115. The identities of callers will be kept confidential.
