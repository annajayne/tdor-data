> Regina Haskins lived quietly in a Bronx apartment building, attracting little attention and making only a few acquaintances.
> 
> Now police are trying to figure out who killed [her].
> 
> Haskins, a [trans woman] who performed in Manhattan nightclubs and worked as a hairdresser by day, was found dead in [her] Soundview apartment early on the morning of April 4. [She] had been shot at least twice, once in the neck and once in the head. A third wound on [her] leg may also have been a gunshot, police said.
> 
> “[She] used to live in Manhattan,” said 43rd Precinct Detective Gil Ramirez, who is investigating the case. “All [her] friends are in Manhattan.""
> 
> Most people didn’t even know Haskins was [trans]. “She lived as a woman,” said “Gigi,” who described herself as a family member and has stayed in touch with Ramirez on the case. “She would talk to men who didn’t know who she was. She never went as far as a kiss, but if a man grabbed her hand, she wouldn’t necessarily pull away.”
> 
> Gigi said she and Haskins grew up in Norfolk, Va. “She knew what she wanted, she knew what she was going to be, and gradually came into it,” Gigi said. “She started calling herself Regina when she was 14.”
> 
> Gigi said Haskins stopped using [her deadname] and wouldn’t acknowledge it. [Her] name was legally changed to Regina.
> 
> Haskins wanted to perform professionally and participated in several transvestite pageants in Virginia and other parts of the country. He also performed in London. Five years ago, Haskins came to New York to pursue a professional performing career. “She also wanted to be a professional makeup artist and hair stylist,” Gigi said.
> 
> Haskins was last seen getting into a cab after performing at The Web, a Manhattan dance club. “[She] got home at 4:45 a.m., and at 5:45, we got the first 911 call,” Ramirez said.  Neighbors told cops they heard an argument and gunshots. When police arrived at the Elder Ave. apartment, they saw blood seeping under the front door. They opened the door to find Haskins’ body sprawled nearby.
>
> Ramirez said there were signs of a struggle, and there was evidence Haskins knew [her] killer. “After he was shot the first time, in the neck, [she] fell to the floor,” Ramirez said. “[She] pleaded with the killer not to shoot.”
> 
> Witnesses told police they saw a man leaving the scene, but nothing is known about him, Ramirez said. “They took away a caring person, my best friend, my sister,” Gigi said. “I’d give my life to get her back, and I would give anything if someone would turn her killer in.
