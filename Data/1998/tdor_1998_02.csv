She died of blunt force trauma to the upper body nineteen days after her 42nd birthday.

> TAMPA - Police seek the public's help in solving Friday's slaying of a cross-dressing [sex worker]. The victim, 42, was bludgeoned. [Her] family gave [her] the name [deadname] Dunn, but the [trans sex worker] found dead Friday preferred to be called Tasha. Killed just 19 days after [her] 42nd birthday, Dunn was beaten to [her] last breath, police said. 
>
> [Her] body, clad in pants, a jacket and a bra, was discovered shortly after 4:30 a.m. in the parking lot of a vacant business at Nebraska Avenue and Yukon Street. Dunn wasn't wearing any shoes. Three days later, detectives said they have little to go on.
>
> They are seeking the public's help. ""A lot of people seem to know him in the area near Busch Boulevard and Nebraska Avenue,"" Tampa homicide Detective Jerry Clark said. ""We're hoping someone will come forward."" Jail records show that Dunn, whose last known address was an apartment at 4206 N. 10th St., was arrested 23 times since October 1987. Most charges were prostitution-related, but there also were several drug arrests.
>
> The day before [she] died, Dunn was sentenced to jail after a judge found [her] guilty of trespassing in an unoccupied building and possessing marijuana, court records show. Dunn was released because [she] received credit for time served. Dunn had no family in the Tampa area, detectives said, and officials had not determined a motive Monday. ""I don't even want to speculate,"" Clark said. ""The truth is, we don't know."" Records show Dunn had been arrested previously at the corner of Nebraska Avenue and Yukon Street.
>
> A beat-up couch and television set had been dumped in the small lot where [her] body was found, but authorities don't believe Dunn was living there. Police first learned of the slaying when a passer-by knocked on a neighbor's door and told them to call 911. The passer-by was gone when authorities arrived.

> Dunn, 42, was shoeless and clad in pants and a jacket, [her] upper body beaten and bloody. Dunn had been arrested nearly two dozen times in the past 10 years, often for prostitution or narcotics. [She] was one of a half-dozen [trans sex workers] who work a stretch of Nebraska where [her] body was found, police say.

"Jacqueline Julita Anderson (""Octavia"")",29,,,,24-Feb-1998,tdor.info/24 Feb 1998/Jacqueline Julita Anderson,,,Portland,Oregon,USA,45.516018,-122.681425,violence,shot,"Jacqueline and her cisgender partner Barbara Gilpin were shot in the head with a shotgun by Jacqueline's ex Eric Walter Running.

> Man convicted of killing lesbian couple PORTLAND (AP) - A fit of jealous rage led a Portland man to gun down a lesbian couple in a bar in 1998, a Multnomah County jury decided Wednesday.
>
> Jurors rejected the insanity defense of Eric Walter Running, 49, charged in the Feb. 24, 1998 killings of Jacqueline Anderson - his former girlfriend - and her lover, Barbara Gilpin.
>
> After deliberating for just an hour, the jury unanimously convicted Running of aggravated murder. They will meet July 17 to decide whether he should be executed or face life in prison.
>
> Running and Anderson, who was also known as ""Octavia,"" had been in a relationship for about two years before the murders. Prosecutors had said the couple fought at the bar and Running stormed off, returning to find Anderson, 29, joined by Gilpin, 44, an off-and-on live-in lover.
>
> A waitress who was working at the Ambassador Restaurant and Lounge in 1998, said Running told Anderson ""To come outside or I'll kill you."" The waitress testified that Running returned with the gun sometime later and shot the two women.
>
> Jurors on Wednesday determined that Running knew exactly what he was doing when he killed the women in front of almost 20 witnesses at the karaoke lounge.

On 28th July 2000 Running was sentenced to death for their murders. An appeal was rejected in 2004 and, as of August 2021, he remains on Death Row.
