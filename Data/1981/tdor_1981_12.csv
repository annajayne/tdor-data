> NEW YORK -- A 40-year-old man convicted of killing a woman on Christmas Eve in 1957 has been arrested in the stabbing death of a male [trans sex worker] this Christmas, it was disclosed today.
>
The New York Daily News said the link between the suspect in the recent slaying, Warren Yaeger, and the stabbing murder 24 years ago was made after a former reporter who covered the original case recognized the name.
>
> In the last killing, Yaeger was charged with stabbing Terry Wilson, 30, on a street in Queens on Christmas Day. Wilson was a [trans sex worker], police said.
>
> Yaeger had been sentenced to life in prison in July 1958 for the murder of Mary Nerich, 44.Mrs. Nerich was stabbed 15 times with a pocket knife during a robbery Dec. 24, 1957 in Queens. Her killer escaped with $45 in cash and a $350 Christmas bonus check.
>
> In that case, police were led to Yaeger, who was then 16, by an obscene phrase the attacker had carved in a phone booth and scrawled in lipstick on the dead woman's purse. The name 'Warren' also was etched in the phone booth.
