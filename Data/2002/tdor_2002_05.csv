> A man dressed ""like a ninja"" in black clothing broke into McMurtry's house through a glass back door at around 6:45 am, said Columbus police spokeswoman Sherry Mercurio. McMurtry's roommate Brian Bass tried to stop the masked assailant but the attacker cut Bass' hand with a katana, or samurai sword.
