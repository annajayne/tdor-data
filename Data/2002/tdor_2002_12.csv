She died at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital after she was removed from life support.

> Nizah Morris was a beloved figure. She was a weekly performer at Bob and Barbara’s. She founded a trans Buddhist faith group, something that drew national attention. She mentored younger trans women in the city and had a way with them. “A lot of the younger girls in the trans community, Nizah was always so sweet to them,” trans advocate Deja Lynn Alvarez told the Daily Beast.

After her death, local authorities declined to release comprehensive information about the circumstances of her case, insisting that they wanted to protect the “integrity” of the investigation. Their handling of her death sparked protests in the LGBT community and led to several investigations into the police coverup of her death.

> Asa Khalif, a local activist with a reputation as a lightning rod who uses tactics of disruptive behavior and in-your-face confrontations, might just be mellowing ... at least when it comes to the case of Nizah Morris.
> 
> Thirty years after attending his first protest against trans violence, Khalif, who has been arrested multiple times for alleged offenses such as disorderly conduct, use of obscene language and defiant trespass, says he’s now willing to cooperate with local authorities to get answers in the Nizah Morris homicide.

> 
> Morris’ friends and supporters, including Khalif, demanded answers. In the weeks after Morris died in 2002, Khalif participated in a Center City protest that attracted hundreds of participants, then held a press conference at the William Way LGBT Center demanding a thorough investigation of the homicide.
> 
> But still, the police refused to disclose details about their investigation.  
> 
> Khalif said he knew Morris, who regularly attended LGBT Pride events and performed drag on a weekly basis at Bob and Barbara’s Lounge on South Street.
> 
> “I met Nizah as a young activist and we immediately hit it off,” Khalif recalled. “She was always warm, always looking out for other people. Nizah had a great personality. So it was very difficult not to be friends with her.”
> 
> The community respected Nizah, Khalif said. “I think that’s why this case resonates so much with people.”
> 
> In 2008, the city Law Department publicly admitted the police department’s entire Morris homicide file had been missing since 2003. That news raised questions about prior assurances of a proper investigation. The Police Advisory Commission promptly reopened its Morris investigation, and in April 2013 called for state and federal probes.

Ze Galhinha,,,,,31-Dec-2002,tdor.info/Dec 2004/Ze Galhinha,,,Brazil,-10.861639,-53.104038,violence,shot,"Ze was shot, allegedly by a military police officer.

> IGLRC-. At the end of December 2002, a military policeman whose last name is Edras murdered a transsexual known as Ze Galhinha, in the street and in front of several witnesses. The police refused to hear the testimony of the witnesses and did not arrest who appeared as a murderer. The gay organization of the place, AAGLT (Amazon Association of Gays, Lesbians and Travestis) launched a campaign in the media, called for street demonstrations and won the support of the Legislature to investigate the crime. Marcelo Cruz, a lawyer who advised a local deputy, took the case and a judge ordered the preventive detention of police Edras. Then, both the lawyer Cruz and Adamor Guedes, president of the AAGLT suffered harassment and threats on several occasions. On January 27, Marcelo Cruz was murdered in his apartment. The threats against the life of Adamor Guedes continued. The AAGLT has requested protection for the life of its president, without that until now the authorities have responded.
