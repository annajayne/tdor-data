Paola Matos,31,,2002_07_22_Paola-Matos.jpg,http://wearinggayhistory.com/exhibits/show/advocacyexhibit/remember,22-Jul-2002,tdor.info/22 Jul 2002/Paola Matos,"Brooklyn, New York",New York,USA,40.692529,-73.990996,violence,strangled,"Paola was fund dead in her home by her boyfriend with a cord wrapped around her throat.

Paola had only recently moved to New York after having surgery abroad. She was discovered in her home by her live-in boyfriend with a white cord wrapped around her throat.

Police ruled her death a homicide. In December 2004, Wanda Batista was acquitted of her murder.

> “The motive was money,” a law-enforcement source told The Post of the 2004 case. “They went there to rob her and ended up killing her,” the source said of victim Paola Matos, 31, a post-op transsexual who was found dead in the bedroom of her Bay Ridge apartment brothel.
> 
> “Police believed she was the killer — just the jury didn’t believe it,” the source said of Batista, who was a 24-year-old admitted prostitute at the time she was charged with choking Matos with her hands in a dispute over $4,000 Batista had allegedly made turning tricks but had failed to turn over to the doomed madam.
> 
> Batista fled to Puerto Rico after the killing, but was arrested there and brought back for trial, the source said. Jurors acquitted her of murder but hung on a charge of manslaughter. The case was not retried.
