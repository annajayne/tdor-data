Amy Soos,,,2002_02_16_Amy-Soos.jpg,http://wearinggayhistory.com/exhibits/show/advocacyexhibit/remember,16-Feb-2002,tdor.info/2-16-2002/Amy (Raymond) Soos,,,Phoenix,Arizona,USA,33.448204,-112.072585,violence,beaten,"Amy was found beaten to death in a roadway after failing to return home one night.

She lived on the Salt River Pima Indian Reservation in Arizona, but often went into Phoenix in the evenings.

> On February 16, 2002, just weeks before Lucero's murder, Soos hopped into a stranger's car for the last time. Phoenix police determined that Soos, after a night in downtown Phoenix, was picked up somewhere near the former Cruisin' Central (a gay bar that has since moved to Seventh Street, and is now known as Cruisin' 7th), either turning a trick or just looking for a ride back to her home on the reservation just south of Casino Arizona.
> 
> Soos' body was discovered by hot-air balloonists, lying in the middle of Jomax Road near Cave Creek. She had been beaten, run over several times by the car in which she was picked up, and left for dead.
