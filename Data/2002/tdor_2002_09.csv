She died from a single gunshot wound to the head. Her alleged killer, Jason Lee Starkey, was being sought by police when he was shot dead two weeks later by Ronald Harry Robbins, 42, a former police officer who was subsequently arrested and charged with second-degree murder. 

According to reports, Starkey had been at a Daytona Beach strip club called Lollipops and was drunk that morning when he and Danielle began to argue, though what they were arguing about wasn't clear.

Danielle worked at a hair salon by day, and as a sex worker in the evening.
