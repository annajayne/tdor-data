> A brutal murder has shocked the local community in Kanchanaburi province, where a 38-year-old transgender woman was found dead in her bedroom, shot through the head. Her missing assets suggest a robbery, with the victim’s father pleading for assistance to find the ruthless murderer, who is believed to be an acquaintance.
> 
> Police captain Mana Samranwong, along with investigation officers from Kanchanaburi province and Mueang Kanchanaburi Police Station, arrived at a residence in Nong Bua, Mueang district, Kanchanaburi province. They were there to investigate the murder of Phanuchaya (surname withheld for privacy), a 38 year old employee at a local department store and a transgender woman.
> 
> Phanuchaya was found face-down on her bed, a pillow covering the back of her head which bore the evidence of a bullet fired through it. The victim was lying in a pool of blood, having been dead for at least 14 hours, according to the medical examiner. A .38 calibre shell casing was found beside the bed, indicating the likely weapon used in the killing.
> 
> Upon inspection, several personal items were missing from Phanuchaya’s residence. These included a gold ring, two mobile phones, and 5,000 baht in coins. Additionally, her motorcycle and house keys disappeared. The perpetrator had locked the house from the inside and used a master key to secure the front gate from the outside before fleeing the scene.


Ariya worked in a department store.

After her murder the killer (presumably using one of her stolen phones) taunted police via her Facebook account.

> Adding to the horror, a colleague of the deceased discovered an eerie status update on Phanuchaya’s Facebook account shortly after news of her death broke.
> 
> The status, which was not there before, asked, “Do you know who killed Ariya?” A smiling emoji featured alongside it. Ariya was an alternate name Phanuchaya used on one of her Facebook profiles. This led to the speculation that the suspect used the stolen phone to mock law enforcement and taunt them about their inability to catch him.

I booked a dentist as she needed dental work and had gotten her some clothes. But I made an appointment with her and she didn't show up. I thought it was strange and called some people and found out that she was murdered”, said Marinalva.

> Our amazing, beautiful, and so very loved first-born child, sister, grandchild, and friend, “Care” Hansen left this world on Thursday, December 14th, 2023 at the tender age of 21, to return home to Heaven. Care was a warrior who valiantly fought a long, difficult battle with mental illness and tried so hard to stay with us as long as possible. Each day Care survived was a victory, and we are So. Very. Grateful. for each and every one of those days that we were blessed to have Care in our lives. Our family will never be the same.
> 
> Care packed an amazing amount of life into their short 21 years on this earth. Care was born on May 8, 2002 at Jordan Valley Hospital in West Jordan, Utah, to thrilled parents [names redacted]. [They were] their first child, as well as the first grandchild on both sides, and was welcomed into the world with great anticipation and much love and affection from the new parents, grandparents, great-grandparents, aunts, and uncles.
> 
> Care had an amazing love for all animals and living creatures. As a young child, [they] loved to pet bees and hold spiders and snakes. Care had many pets throughout life, including a cat, turtle, ferrets, snake, lizards, fish, frogs and toads, rats, chickens, hamsters, and various birds that Care rescued and rehabilitated. Currently, Care has a beloved Seppala Siberian Husky named Mollie, who brought Care so much comfort.
>
> Care was incredibly smart and dedicated and did well in whatever they put their mind to. They took school and study very seriously and always got excellent grades, even pulling off a perfect 4.0 many quarters throughout middle and high school. (All this, despite the extra hardship of struggling with dyslexia that wasn’t diagnosed or accommodated until partway through their junior year in high school.) Care attended South Jordan Montessori Preschool, Southland Elementary School, Oquirrh Hills Middle School, and Riverton High School, participating in many choirs and plays, and earning countless honors and recognitions along the way, including Eagle of the Quarter, Student of the Month, National Honor Society, Academic Letters, and so on. Care graduated from Riverton High School in 2020 and later received an Associate’s degree from Salt Lake Community College in 2022. Care was currently working to get into a nursing program and could be found studying hard for finals right up until their passing.
> 
> One of Care’s favorite hobbies was to participate as a background actor in movies and tv shows. Care was a featured extra in the Scott Sterling and other Studio C sketches, several religious films, including The Chosen, some Hallmark and similar Christmas movies, several seasons of the High School Musical series, and others. Care enjoyed involving family and friends in these experiences, and we were always excited to see Care on the screen and their name in the credits. Care’s professionalism and talent made them a favorite of several casting directors and was always invited back.
> 
> Care was always very sensitive to those with special needs and made some very dear friends through interactions with peer tutoring, special needs seminary, and while working as a camp counselor at an adaptive summer camp during high school. Care’s love for these friends was sincere, and they really seemed to understand that.
> 
> Care had a love for the LGBTQ community, of which they were a part. Care came out publicly as non-binary several years ago and has since been exploring their gender, using various pronouns, and even briefly testing out a masculine name, by which some people have known Care recently. Care had also begun to reconnect with their feminine side and shared several experiences with us demonstrating that. One thing for certain is that though Care was known in different ways by different people, they were a shining example of love to all. Care touched the lives of so many members of the LGBTQ community, making countless friends and helping them to feel accepted and to accept themselves. Care enjoyed attending a variety of activities and events, including those at Encircle, Love Loud, and the Pride Festival, proudly participating in the parade each year. Our family always loved and accepted Care for who they were. We hope all will honor Care’s legacy by continually striving to always show love and acceptance to others.
> 
> Care’s many passions included compassionate care and nursing. Care became a Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA) during high school and worked at Legacy House of South Jordan (an assisted living and memory care facility) for over four years, starting as a senior in high school and up until their passing. At the time of their passing, Care was one of the most senior CNAs and Med Techs there and took the job very seriously. Care was a healthcare hero during the pandemic and worked tirelessly through several outbreaks at their facility. Care had such a love for the residents there and became close with many of them, being an integral part of the last months, days, and even moments of so many. It was a heavy burden and took a toll on Care to be around during the deaths of so many people who truly mattered to them, but Care sincerely loved these people and was honored to be with them through these times.
> 
> Another of Care’s great passions was traveling and humanitarian work, which often went hand in hand for Care. A lifetime of travel was packed into Care’s short 21 years, with visits to 21 countries before turning 20, including every continent except Antarctica. Care’s father was their travel buddy throughout most of these travels, visiting nearly all those countries together, often just the two of them, as they explored the world and adventured together, having incredible experiences and making unbelievable memories that will last forever. Care went on humanitarian trips to Uganda, Kenya, Paraguay, Peru, and Thailand, including spending several months living abroad in Africa as a humanitarian worker during the Covid pandemic. Care truly loved and cared about people on a very personal level and touched the lives of countless people in countries all around the world, where they still have friends and loved ones to this day. Traveling is one of our family’s favorite past times, and we were blessed to go on many family trips with Care. Care was always up for an adventure and made our travels so much fun. We will always cherish these memories.
> 
> To our dear, wonderful Care: Your presence in our lives is one of the greatest gifts we could ever have received. You brought so much joy and beauty into the world. We take comfort in the knowledge that you are no longer suffering, but life without you is going to be SO hard. We will miss you every day. We know you will be there to greet us when the time comes for us to be reunited. Until then, stay near and continue to share your love with us, as we will with you.

> The trans woman identified as Jessica Hadassa was shot to death on Thursday night (14). The crime took place in the municipality of Parintins, in the interior of Amazonas, hours after she was accused of raping a 5-year-old child.
> 
> The child is the daughter of a friend of Jessica's, with whom she was living in the Teixeirão neighborhood, in that city. She was reported by the child's mother, who went to the police station after arriving home and the child complaining of pain in the abdominal region.
> 
> The mother took the child to the hospital believing that her daughter had stomach pain, but the medical team detected bleeding in the victim's private parts.
> 
> Upon returning home, the child reportedly said he didn't want to go home anymore. The mother soon suspected that Jessica had raped the girl and reported her to the police.
> 
> Jessica was arrested, but denied the crime. The child was subjected to tests, but as the results did not indicate sexual abuse [Jessica] was released.
> 
> Hours later, Jessica was found dead on a road with four gunshots, one in the head and the rest in the neck and arms.
> 
> According to Assotram, in the last four years there have been 12 homicides, three attempted homicides and two crimes of transphobia. This year, five homicides against LGBT people were reported in Amazonas.

> “Due to false information and no evidence, Jéssica Haddassa was killed. She was innocent and did no harm to anyone”, said the president of the Association of Gays, Lesbians and Transvestites of Parintins (AGLTPIN), Fernando de Souza Moraes. The trans woman enters the statistics as the seventeenth victim of transphobia in the State in the last four years, according to data from the Association of Transvestites, Transsexuals and Transgenders of the State of Amazonas (ASSOTRAM).
> 
> According to Fernando Moraes, in addition to being a trans woman, the victim was a Person with Disabilities (PwD) and indigenous. 
> 
> “She had difficulty speaking our language and had a mild degree of Down Syndrome. I had known her for five years. For us, it wasn't a hate crime, what happened was a failure of justice,” said Moraes.

> Tripp passed away unexpectedly on 12/18/2023 in Salt Lake City, Utah.
>
> To know Tripp was to immediately love Tripp. He had a smile that lit up the room, and a booming contagious laugh that instantly drew people to want to meet him. He was a fiercely loyal friend to anyone he met and would go to the ends of the Earth to help and protect those in need. Tripp was a strong advocate, participating in peaceful protests and shielding members of his community; He could be found joyously participating in LGBTQIA+ celebrations and advocating for the queer community. Tripp also loved children and often rose to action in championing for their safety - kids adored Tripp and found kinship in his forever-young personality and the safe space he created. He always extended his hand to those who felt lost or scared, and many found continuous respite in his company.
>
> Tripp was an avid musician, playing bass guitar in multiple bands and touring with his bandmates in Consumed by Silence, The Lament Configuration and many more. Tripp loved horror movies and was particularly interested in early horror films from the 1930s and '50s, such as Frankenstein, The Invisible Man and Creature from the Black Lagoon. He enjoyed camping and being in nature, often surrounded by friends; he enjoyed working with his hands and had a natural skill in carpentry and mechanics, and could often be found working on cars or putting together a new project. He took special interest in robotics, space exploration and theoretical physics.
>
> Tripp made a career in managing and tending the bar at local pubs like Piper Down and Citizens, and was passionate about his work there; he loved his regular patrons who would stop in to grab a bite or a quick drink, and his coworkers quickly became a close-knit family; his open-armed approach to everyone who entered the doors made a huge impact on all those he came in contact with.
>
> Tripp made a deep impact on the lives of all those who found him. The amount of support, love and admiration to come forth since his departure shows just how truly and deeply he loved and was loved by everyone who knew him, even briefly.
>
> In lieu of flowers or cards, we have several very important requests for those that loved him, knew him, or are reading about him for the very first time here. This is how my brother would want to be remembered and have his memory honored.
>
> First, always be unapologetically yourself. Love yourself. Shine bright and true.
>
> Second, love hard and unconditionally. Surround yourself with the people that lift you up and be the voice and shoulder for those who need it. And finally, if you ever feel lost and alone know that he will always be with us. Energy like Tripp's will live forever.

> 
> The charging document states Delen began to drive away and Lewis followed on foot. Delen then stopped his car and got out, the dispute escalated, and, ""during the altercation, Delen produced his firearm and fired one round, striking Lewis in the left abdomen.""
