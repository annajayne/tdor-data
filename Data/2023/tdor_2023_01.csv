> On January 4th, my sweet sister, Gwen, passed away at the age of 22.
>
> Words cannot begin to express my grief and pain as we process this devastating loss in our family. A piece of me will forever be missing as I try to understand why this had to happen, why she had to go, why we couldn’t save her. Gwen was the strongest person I knew who took on every hurdle in life with grace and perseverance.
> 
> Diagnosed with a debilitating chronic disease at 14, Gwen went through more in her teen years than what many go through in a lifetime. Constant surgeries, months-long stays in the hospital, having a damn colostomy bag as a freshman in high school. I never could’ve survived what she went through, and certainly not with the positive attitude that she always had. Coming out as a trans woman at 19 brought on a new set of challenges Gwen had to navigate while the world continued to work against her. What never changed was her endearing personality and welcoming heart. There was nobody else more brave, witty, compassionate, and strong. She was a light in every life she touched.
> 
> I am at a loss of how to continue on knowing she’s gone from our world. Gwen was my only full sibling — we were like two peas in a pod growing up. Our family is forever broken without her. The immense grief we feel not understanding why this happened is overwhelming. So many unanswered questions and what-if’s. So many regrets and wishes to turn back time to try to make it all better for her. I feel like I’m at the bottom of a 100-feet hole and I’ll never be able to get back out. I love you so much Gwen, and I am so sorry.

Two suspects have been arrested.

> The Civil Police of Minas Gerais (PCMG) clarified the death of a 25-year-old trans woman, who had been missing since January 4, in the municipality of Ubá, in the Zona da Mata region of Minas Gerais. After investigative work, on Tuesday (7/2), two suspects, aged 28 and 29, were temporarily arrested for the practice of qualified homicide and concealment of a corpse.

> During searches carried out to collect materials of interest to the investigation, a human skeleton, supposedly of the victim, was also located, yesterday, in a stream in the neighboring municipality, Tocantins. Genetic materials, including those from family members, are being collected and will be forwarded to Instituto Médico Legal Dr. André Roquette, PCMG unit in Belo Horizonte, to carry out a DNA comparison test.

> During a press conference held this Wednesday (8/2), Douglas Motta spoke about the investigation of the facts. According to him, as soon as the PCMG became aware of the disappearance, steps were taken to try to locate the victim. “During the investigations, it was found that the trans woman had been murdered”, explained the delegate, informing that surveys by the PCMG showed that a 28-year-old trans woman is suspected of being the mastermind of the homicide and her boyfriend, of 29, the executor of the crime.
> 
> Investigations by the Civil Police indicated that the victim was last seen getting inside the man's vehicle, at Praça Getúlio Vargas, in Ubá, heading towards the city of Tocantins. Preliminary investigations indicate that the victim would have been executed with a firearm fired in the frontal region of the head.
> 
> The crime would have happened for reasons of revenge, due to a previous disagreement, in November last year, when there was a fight between the victim and the investigated. Investigations continue. “We do not rule out the possibility of a possible participant in this fact”, Douglas pointed out.

She had been reported missing by her partner after she did not return from going out on a date.

> 
> She’s 5'10"" and weighs about 230 pounds. Johnson has hazel eyes and dark brown, shoulder-length hair and was last seen wearing a grey shirt with gold writing, black leggings and blue slides. Somehow it feels important to describe how she chose to dress, perhaps because she is being misgendered and deadnamed both in the search when she was missing and in her death by family and friends. One positive note is that media is respecting her identity as a woman.
> 
> Her partner last saw Johnson on Friday, Jan. 13 when Johnson left their home and said she would be back in an hour.
> 
> Bulla and KC met in August and have lived together for several months. They found solace and love together as trans woman. Bulla says KC was the love of her life. “It is not fair that was taken away from me. It’s not fair that she was taken away from all her friends and family either.”

Hicks is currently being held at the Myrtle Beach Police Department under no bond, according to WECT

Police subsequently arrested William Haven Hicks, 26, in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Hicks faces three counts of first degree murder, robbery with a dangerous weapon, and kidnapping, and is currently awaiting extradition to North Carolina without bond. Investigators believe Hicks met Johnson on social media not long before her murder.

> February 3, 2023. The murder of María José Torres Astros has generated rejection among her community. On January 18, 2023, the body of this 33-year-old businesswoman was found with a stab wound to her chest in the Mavicure neighborhood of Villavicencio.
> 
> According to the local outlet El Cuarto Mosquetero, Viviana Palacios, Villavicencio's Secretary for Women, rejected this murder and called on the authorities to treat it as transfemicide. This call was joined by Raiza Parra, a trans woman human rights defender, stressing that this is the second homicide of an LGBTIQ+ person in Meta in 2023. On social networks, the authorities have been sued to provide an effective response to this case using the hashtag #JusticiaParaMajo.
> 
> Therefore, the Office of the Attorney General of the Nation is required to quickly investigate this case, based on the possibility that it is a case of homicide motivated by prejudiced motives regarding the gender identity of María José. In all the events registered against LGBTIQ+ people there must be an analysis that includes the possibility of violence due to prejudice towards people with diverse sexual orientations, identities and gender expressions.
>

> Amid the ongoing fight to defend Atlanta’s South River Forest from the construction of a law enforcement training village, a beloved queer community organizer, Tortuguita, was shot and killed by police last Wednesday. 
> 
> In August 2021, Atlanta’s government announced the construction of an 85-acre police training facility in the South River Forest, also known as the Weelaunee Forest, located just outside of the city. Protestors have nicknamed the development “Cop City,” and have decried its potential to militarize the police — plans reportedly include several gun ranges, models of city blocks to be used in training demonstrations, and more — and its environmental impact, given its location within one of Atlanta’s largest remaining green spaces and a poor, predominantly Black area. Accordingly, a diverse coalition of protesters have been organizing against the Cop City proposal for a year, including by occupying the forest in protest camps. 
> 
> Tortuguita, an Indigenous Venezuelan who was also queer and nonbinary, was a forest defender who was killed during a SWAT operation to clear a protest camp, per The Appeal. In a statement to multiple media outlets, an anonymous forest defender stated that gunfire was heard Wednesday morning around 9 A.M. Authorities have claimed that Tortuguita was told by police to exit their tent, and that they were the first to shoot, injuring a Georgia State Patrol Trooper. Police reportedly shot back, killing the 26-year-old activist. Police say that there is no body camera footage of the encounter available, causing activists to question their version of events. 
> 
> Tortuguita was vocally committed to nonviolence: “We get a lot of support from people who live here, and that’s important because we win through nonviolence,” they told the magazine Bitter Southerner in a December profile. “We’re not going to beat them at violence. But we can beat them in public opinion, in the courts even.”
> 
> A GoFundMe for the activist’s funeral costs states that Tortuguita was “always the biggest light in any room they entered.” The Atlanta Press Collective wrote that Tortuguita “spent their time between Atlanta, defending the forest from destruction and coordinating mutual aid for the movement and Florida where they helped build housing in low income communities hit hardest by the hurricane.”
> 
> “They were a trained medic, a loving partner, a dear friend, a brave soul, and so much more,” the statement reads. 
> 
> People around the country hosted vigils for Tortuguita after they were killed, from Oakland to Miami to Madison, Wisconsin. The Atlanta Press Collective also published anonymous tributes to the activist, with multiple people lauding their commitment to the QTBIPOC community. “They loved all life and people — especially their qtpoc community — deeply,” one mourner wrote.

Dozens of people and groups have decided to raise her voice for her de ella, to demand justice and that her crime does not go unpunished.

As reported, her body de ella was found between Norte 74 and Oriente 125, in the Aragón Inguarán neighborhood.
> 
> The organization wrote about this crime: “If, ladies and gentlemen, we women carry the prejudices of a misogynistic society, it is a consequence of the derision that we live in public and private spaces all our lives ; Even on our deathbed, people continue to misuse our identity to turn it into a media morbidity, or to not talk at all about this violence, like what is happening in this case.”

> “Maria Jose was a joy to work with. I always looked forward to speaking with her. She was lively, funny, and dynamic. My heart hurts from her loss. Transgender people who are immigrants suffer two levels of oppression and marginalization from society. This makes them especially vulnerable to harm.

Two other trans women and her mother's boyfriend were also critically injured in the mass shooting.

> Unique Banks, a 21-year-old Latinx transgender woman, was fatally shot during a home invasion in Chicago Monday.
>
> Banks’s mother, Alexsandra Olmo, was also killed in the invasion of the family’s apartment, the Chicago Sun-Times reports. Three other people — Olmo’s boyfriend and two trans women — were seriously wounded, a law enforcement source told the paper. They are hospitalized in critical condition. The source added that there was no evidence of anti-trans motivation, although police said the attack was not random.
>
> But Banks’s father, Omar Burgos, said many questions remain. “Nobody just goes to your house and just starts killing people,” Burgos, who lives in Orlando, told the Sun-Times. “Something happened, but what happened? I don’t know.”
>
> He said he worried about Banks and her two siblings after he moved to Florida, where he is a mechanic for American Airlines, more than a decade ago. He had hoped she would come to Florida to live with him, he said, noting that his “heart is torn apart.”
>
> The Chicago Police Department released a statement saying the department “is still investigating this incident and will provide additional information after speaking with people close to the victims, out of respect for the victims and their families.”
>
> Banks’s death is at least the third violent killing of a trans, nonbinary, or gender-nonconforming person in the U.S. this year. The Human Rights Campaign pointed out that there is not only an epidemic of violence against this population but also an epidemic of gun violence. There have been 40 mass shootings in the nation in 2023, with a mass shooting defined as one in which at least four people are shot, excluding the person wielding the gun, according to the Gun Violence Archive.
>
> “Unique Banks was just 21 years old, and she was killed in a horrific mass shooting that also targeted her family and friends,” Tori Cooper, director of community engagement for HRC’s Transgender Justice Initiative, said in a press release. “The rate of gun violence in this country is out of control. It tears families apart and leaves communities grieving and traumatized. We know from other countries that tighter gun laws work to dramatically reduce firearm-related deaths. Lawmakers must act to end the violence.”
>
> Banks is also at least the 13th transgender or gender-nonconforming person killed in Chicago, the most in any city, since HRC began tracking this information in 2013.
>
> Equality Illinois released a statement on the shooting as well, writing, “We call on the Mayor to take immediate action and ensure resources are allocated to support the victims and their families and to find answers to these heinous acts of violence. The time is now to end systemic racism and transphobia so that we may pursue dignity for those who are no longer with us and for those whose lives hang in the balance.”

Three dats after the shooting, police identified and arrested a 19-year-old suspect. However, they have so far declined to press charges.

> Prosecutors have declined to charge a man identified as the person who burst into a South Shore apartment last month and opened fire during an apparent robbery attempt, killing a mother and her transgender daughter and wounding three others, including two other trans women.
>
> Late on Jan. 26, three days after the mass shooting, Chicago police executed a warrant at the same apartment complex in the 2900 block of East 78th Street where the 19-year-old suspect also lives, according to an arrest report obtained through a public records request.
>
> He had been identified in photo lineups as the person who forced his way into the apartment, demanded cash and shot the five victims, according to the report. He was arrested but ultimately released from custody on Jan. 29. The Sun-Times isn’t identifying the suspect because he hasn’t been charged with a crime.
>
> The arrest report shows felony charges weren’t brought by prosecutors and the case was marked as a continuing investigation. It was kicked back to police “pending further investigation.”
>
> A spokesperson for the state’s attorney’s office said prosecutors “did not approve or reject charges” in the case. “After a review of the initial information brought to us by CPD, we informed police that additional evidence was needed before a final charging decision could be made,” the spokesperson said. A police spokesperson would only say the investigation remains “open and active.”
>
> The suspect has two pending cases in Cook County court, a felony count of residential burglary and a misdemeanor count of domestic battery, records show. A police report for the mass shooting shows two people “kicked in the front door and began shooting” about 1:40 p.m. on Jan. 23. A witness told investigators that two males ran north from the scene wearing green camouflage.

>
> A San Francisco native and Tenderloin resident, she had served as a program associate in the Transgender District and as a member of the Trans Advisory Committee with the city’s Office of Transgender Initiatives. At the time of her death, Smith was a site supervisor at the Taimon Booton Navigation Center, a trans-specific project of St. James Infirmary, an SF nonprofit that provides health care and resources to sex workers.
>
> As part of the Know Our Places campaign designed to showcase uplifting narratives about trans and gender-nonconforming people, Smith was one of several models whose faces appeared on BART trains and other public places.
>

>
> On Friday, the transgender district will hold a candlelight vigil for Smith at the intersection of Turk and Taylor Streets in the Tenderloin.

> Smith was also part of SFMoma’s SECA Art Prize exhibit, which is currently on view.

SFMOMA plans to hold its own memorial at an unspecified date.
>
> Jupiter Peraza, a trans activist who worked with Smith in the district, remembered her as a “brilliant, brilliant leader”.
>
> “I got to spend a lot of time with Ivory,” Peraza told The Standard. “We’re about the same age, so we definitely have a lot of the same dreams and aspirations for the future. I was always amazed at how she interacted with her community with the utmost grace and respect and love.” She led with kindness.
