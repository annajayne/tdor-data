> 
> They immediately notified the authorities. Paramedics arrived at the site and could only confirm that Violeta Navarrete no longer had vital signs. Elements of the Secretary of Public Security and Citizen Protection of Ahome went to confirm what had happened, and upon verifying that the Queen of Diversity had her skull practically destroyed by goals and was dead, they cordoned off the home, and notified the Attorney General of State Justice.

Eden had allegedly been separated from her support network, isolated, pressured to return to Saudi Arabia and then forced to detransition. The US government is investigating the involvement of a US company employed by her family in convincing her to return.

She worked as a flight attendent and had become well known after sharing her story on her airline’s social media.

> A transgender United flight attendant, who once fronted a powerful campaign video for the airline, has tragically taken her life. Kayleigh Scott, who shared her story for a 2020 Trans Day of Visibility video made by United, explained in an Instagram post she was planning to take her life. 
>
> Followers attempted to reach out to Kayleigh by requesting for a local welfare check, but it was later confirmed that she had passed away. “Thank you for your concern and outpouring of love for her. We are going to miss her so much,” a commenter said on Kayleigh’s post. 
> 
> The Colorado-based flight attendant became known for sharing her story on United’s social media, explaining that she was able to “break free from the chains that held me,” thanks to the help of her colleagues throughout her transition.  “I used to be so embarrassed about being trans, and all I wanted was to blend in and be cis, but times have changed, and I’ve started looking back on the bigger picture and understanding I do have a story to tell,” she said in United’s video.
> 
> “My life changed for the better when I came to United as a flight attendant. With the support from the company, our business resource group for LGBTQ+ employees, and all of my loving coworkers… I’m living confidently as my true self.

Despite her positive testimonial at the time, she gradually became disaffected with the organisation and the lack of support offered to her while she tried to cope with other issues in her life.

> 2022 has been a year packed with upset and difficulty. I saw too much death & loss in my life, I came to realize I work a meaningless job for a company that doesn’t value me as an employee, I had my heart destroyed, I lost my nice little home and had to downsize significantly and start over. I’m really struggling to find happiness and hope. I’m begging 2023 to be better to me. Please.

She was the only known Italian trans survivor of a Nazi concentration camp - she had spent six months being tortured in Dachau.

> Lucy Salani, the only Italian [trans woman] who survived the Nazi concentration camps, has died at the age of [98]. A life, hers, entirely spent as an activist for homosexual and transgender rights.
> 
> A few hours ago, the founder of the Sentinelli and Lombard regional councilor Luca Paladini gave the news: ""Our honorary member Lucy Salani is no longer here. A long life where she experienced the horror of concentration camps and then the freedom to want to be herself"". The woman died in her home in her Bologna, where she had returned in the 80s to take care of her parents and where she remained until the day of her death.
>
> She was born in Fossano as [deadname] Salani and raised in the Emilia-Romagna capital. After having deserted both the Italian fascist and the Nazi armies she has deported to Dachau in 1944.
>
> ""Being trans in that twenty years was terrible"" you recalled some time ago during the inauguration of the Homocaust exhibition dedicated to the forgotten extermination of homosexuals by Nazi-fascism. ""On the issue of rights, Italy is stalled, and it is that suspension that is scary. I would not want us to return to the fascist era"", she added.
> 
> Rejected by both her father and her brothers, she remained in the Nazi concentration camp for six months until the liberation of the camp by the Americans in 1945. ""I got my permits and went all the way home. The Germans were looking for me because I gave a false name and address. Making my situation worse,” said Salani. After the war, she initially lived on expedients such as [sex work], under the name Carmen, but also the dancer and the actress in a show.
> 
> She then moved to Turin, working as an upholsterer and frequenting the Italian and Parisian transsexual scene. After loves that ended or never started, she decided to adopt an 18-year-old single mother: ""I met her when she was a child. Her father worked in the mines, had silicosis and died early. Mom died a few weeks later. The baby came to me. She initially did odd jobs, then she fell in love with an idiot and got pregnant.""

> Lucy's story gained public attention for the first time in 2009, when writer and director Gabriella Romano wrote a biography about her life, named ""Il mio nome è Lucy. L'Italia del XX secolo nei ricordi di una transessuale"". In 2011, Romano also directed a documentary film centered around the activist, named ""Essere Lucy"".
>
> In 2014 she was interviewed by director Gianni Amelio as part of his documentary Felice chi è diverso, and in January 2018, she was invited to take part in a demonstration organized by LGBT rights associations Arcigay and Arcilesbica for the International Holocaust Remembrance Day. On that occasion, she said:
>
> ""It is impossible to forget and forgive. Some nights, I still dream of the most horrendous things I saw, and I feel like I'm still [trapped] there, and so, I want people to know what happened in the concentration camps, so that it won't happen again.""

*[Editor's Note: some reports name the victim as Rose; but according to TDoR France 2023 her name was Roz.]*

> After the suicide of a young trans woman on March 28 in Saint-Étienne, messages made the link between her death and the rape allegedly committed by a volunteer from the association which manages the Clapier. Accused by name, this man disputes the accusations and filed two complaints for defamation and assault.
> 
> Since the end of March, messages on social networks and posters posted in Saint-Étienne accuse of rape a volunteer from the association which manages the cultural venue and performance hall ""Le Clapier"". The person concerned contests these accusations and announces that he filed a complaint on April 11 for defamation and assault. The Saint-Etienne public prosecutor's office opened two investigations, one for rape and the other into the prison inmates allegedly suffered by this man.
> 
> At the origin of this case, there was the suicide of a young 24-year-old trans woman. Her name was Rose, and she ended her life on March 28: she was found hanging in her home. A few days later, messages on social networks, as well as posters in Saint-Étienne and leaflets, made the link between her death and the rape she allegedly suffered shortly before, committed by a volunteer from the Hutch. They give this man's first name and a photo.
> 
> On April 11, the person concerned published a message on Facebook, in which he “totally” contested these accusations. He added that he had filed two complaints, “for defamation, assault, theft during a meeting and damage”. In a press release published four days earlier, his association announced the withdrawal, decided unanimously.
> 
> The Saint-Étienne public prosecutor's office therefore opened two investigations: the first into the rape of Rose, and the second into the reprisals against this volunteer. The investigations are continuing their course this Monday, April 17, explains the Saint-Etienne public prosecutor.
> 
> To these files should be added the complaints that the owner of Le Clapier intends to file. His room has since suffered a break-in attempt, tags and stickers, he explains. In addition to these legal procedures, he explains that he is in the process of ending the rental of his room to this association, with no solution for the moment for the future of the place.
