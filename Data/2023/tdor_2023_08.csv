His killer then also attacked two other people.

> Matthew Torrey Tiggs, 22, is charged in a crime spree that began in the Van Buren Estates mobile home park. He is accused in the fatal shooting of a 26-year-old person; the non-fatal shooting of a 47-year-old man; and the assault of a 45-year-old man, all of Van Buren Township.
> 
> The victim’s name was clarified by the Wayne County Prosecutor’s Office Thursday. After first using a name given to the person at birth, officials in a release issued Thursday afternoon stated the dead man’s name was Jean Butchart. This came after numerous loved ones representing the family contacted The Macomb Daily to say he was a transgender male who identified as Jean and was in the process of legally changing his name when he died. An obituary published on the Nie Family Funeral Home of Ann Arbor’s website Wednesday said he was part of a family with two sisters and was working toward a career in education.
> 
> Jean had two sisters and had completed an Environmental Studies BS and was working professionally in managing water. His obituary reads that “His love of the natural world extended to a love of camping, foraging, gardening, and mushroom-hunting, earning him the affectionate nickname “Nature Boy” among his many friends.” Recently, Jean was planning to return to school to earn a degree in science education.
> 
> In any case, Jean’s death just recently came to attention of those who track the lists. It was heartening to read that his friends and family advocated so strongly for him in the media reporting. One imagines he was surrounded by loving and accepting support system while he lived as well. Jean’s mother, Amy Butchart, described him as “a well-loved person and unofficial leader in the local trans community.” Note that the media reports use Jean Thomas’ name assigned at birth and misgender him.
> 
> Jean Thomas’ was shot at point blank range in his head. The murderer fired the weapon multiple times. And then [attempted] other murders.

Matthew Torrey Tiggs Jr., 22, was subsequently arrested and charged.

> ""I'd rather kill myself than come to Sis."" That's what Kalle, 14 years old, told his emergency family in May. On August 6, Kalle was found dead.
> 
> Kalle is described as curious, quick-thinking and creative. A person who found it easy to learn new things and was liked by everyone. Kalle was born a girl and was named [deadname], but already at the age of 8 began asking his mother questions about gender identity.
> 
> I have always tried to support and answer the questions, even if they were sometimes difficult, says mother Zanele. She says that Kalle, who was still called [deadname] at the time, was sexually assaulted by three older guys shortly before.
> 
> The abuse was discovered by the school, because the boys talked about it. The boys allegedly told my child ""if you want to play with us you have to do this and this"" and then the abuse happened, says the mother. She noticed that Kalle felt bad mentally after the abuse, and tried to support as much as she could. At the same time, Kalle continued to be curious and interested in discussing deeper and more complex issues, such as identity. Kalle sought out older children and that's where the problems eventually started when they got older, says the mother. The other children started trying alcohol and Kalle, who had a lack of impulse control, got hooked - and discovered that it was a way to numb the anxiety.
>
> His mother turned to BUP and social services for help. Kalle was diagnosed with ADHD and depression, and together with the social secretary at the time, [his mother] agreed that Kalle should spend some time away in an attempt to break destructive patterns.
> 
> Instead of feeling better, Kalle's destructive behavior accelerated. Kalle ran away, drank alcohol and tried various forms of drugs. The social service writes in its application for compulsory care that ""Kalle exposes himself to danger through socially destructive behavior in the form of a vagabond lifestyle"" and mentions, among other things, that Kalle had an 18-year-old girlfriend.
> 
> The first emergency placement was an emergency home where the family says they liked Kalle a lot. ""My first impression was that Kalle was a calm guy. He came in straight away and sat down and petted our dog, who also liked him very much"", according to his emergency home mother.
> 
> The two weeks that Kalle should have been placed in emergency care with the family turned into three months. At home, Kalle primarily played music, and was self-taught in both piano and guitar at an advanced level for a 13-year-old. The foster family did not experience the usual challenges that often exist with children who are placed because of their own behavior.
> 
> ""It worked very well with Kalle and we had nice conversations. But he constantly had this anxiety that he wouldn't be allowed to stay but would be locked up. I could see that he felt very bad from that worry and that it was the one that made him run away. It was a shock for me when I understood that they transported him to a completely different institution that was much further away"", said [his emergency home mother].
> 
> Despite the fact that Kalle wanted to be a boy, and at his own request is referred to as ""he"" in all decisions about compulsory care, Kalle ws placed at the Folåsa institution for girls .
> 
> On August 6, Kalle was found dead by suicide in his room at the Sis home. His mother only got the news half a day later.

The cause of her death was not reported.

> On August 10, 2023 the body of a deceased person was discovered by a passerby in front of the St. Vincent de Paul used car lot, State Hwy 99 North. The decedent was recognizable and had only been deceased for a matter of hours.
> 
> Born in Eugene, Oregon, white trans woman Dolli Goins enjoyed watching television, music, reading and spending time with friends. According to her father when describing her final days:
> 
> “I do not claim to know [Dolli] state of mind on August 9th but she made the decision to walk away from her support group of friends in Albany without notifying any of them. [Dolli] ended up in contact with a Linn County Sheriff’s deputy who agreed to give her a ride into Lane County. The report is that there are more resources in Lane County.
>
> ""[Dolli] was last seen walking south through Junction City on August 9th after that contact with the deputy. Jenny and I want to believe that [Dolli] was going to obtain assistance. That night she lay down near HWY 99 and placed her hand behind her head.”
> 
> Dolli’s parents continue to misgender her and use her deadname. While that’s sadly too common, one thing that struck me was the references to mental illness and addiction as contributors to her death, but no mention of the role that family rejection plays in the vulnerability of young people. The research is very clear -acceptance by one adult can reduce the risk of suicidality by 33%.
> 
> Dolli deserved loving acceptance, not tough love. She didn’t die with a smile on her face at peace with a world that rejected and dismissed her. She’s not better off or in a better place. We should have created better places for her in Oregon. The whimsical, quixotic narrative is no less helpful.
>
> Still, I don’t know much about Dolli. Her social media profile is new. I haven’t found friends to talk with. I hope this post brings them out so we can understand her life better. Still, I know she deserved to walk through a safe and careful world.
> 
> Rest in power, Dolli. Your life was important and had value. I am so sorry that the people who needed to show up for you the most continue to erase your truth. I am sorry we collectively did not create a safer world to protect and cherish you. You deserved all of those things.
> 
> May your memory be a revolution.

Although there is no evidence to suggest they identified as trans, it is reasonable to consider them gender nonconforming.

> Thomas was born and raised in Chicago, Illinois. He relocated to East Chicago, Indiana. Thomas graduated from Thornridge High School in 2013 and was working as a cook at a local IHOP. He frequently changed his hairstyle and color, posting many online photos of his artistry. His images are gorgeous.

> Thomas’ friends are grieving the loss of their friend, remembering his as a source of smiles and laughter.

> Sadly, the tragedy is compounded by the ignorant public comments about Thomas’ photos, hair, and aesthetic. One media site identified Thomas as transgender, but there is no evidence to support that. Assigning people labels based on their photos is transphobic. It would be appropriate to describe Thomas as gender nonconforming or gender creative, reflections on the image he presented to the world with his social media. And while gender nonconforming identity can often be found under the transgender umbrella, it does not serve anyone to make that assumption. The comments on that post unleash a torrent of ugly intolerance that dishonors the commenters.

Her killer then set her apartment on fire.

> On August 20, the police received calls about a fire in an apartment on Yeznik Koghbatsi St. in central Yerevan, Armenia’s capital. After the flames were extinguished, officers found a corpse marred by lacerations. They later confirmed that Adriana, at age 28, had been stabbed to death and her apartment set on fire.

> Police arrested the 26-year-old suspect at a border checkpoint in Bavra along Armenia’s northern border, as he was attempting to flee to Georgia. He has admitted to committing murder, and law enforcement has launched criminal proceedings.

Adriana was apparently a gentle person. A friend said this of her:
 
> “Adriana could never hurt or cause anyone pain. She was an extremely good and kind person. She was not for this world. This world is very evil.”
