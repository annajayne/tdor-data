> It is incredibly heartbreaking to have to share that his son, my nephew Allen died this past Sunday evening. Allen was so like his father in many ways, besides looking like him he was crazy smart and had a curious nature just like his Dad. Allen totally dug bugs and could share all kinds of interesting factoids about them. He was huge fan of anime and was incredibly interested in asian culture and languages. He was in college at Brockport and was pursuing a biology degree with the goal of because a pharmacist. He delayed his entry to college, taking a semester off to get top surgery. As a transgender man this was an exciting step for him in his journey towards being his true self. His true self was smart and funny and sweet and shy and he has left this world way too soon.

> D.C. police are investigating the unexplained death of a 30-year-old transgender woman, Skylar Harrison Reeves, whose partially naked body was found on a park bench in a secluded section of Marvin Gaye Park on Oct. 2.
> 
> A Metropolitan Police Department spokesperson told the Washington Blade detectives from the department’s natural death squad are investigating the case as detectives await a determination by the D.C. Office of the Chief Medical Examiner of the cause and manner of death, which could take up to 60 days or more.
> 
> But [name redacted], Skylar’s aunt, told the Blade that a homicide detective came to her house in Capitol Heights, Md., where Skylar was living, to inform her that her niece was found deceased in a D.C. park with her belongings missing and the dress she was wearing pulled up over her head, with her breasts exposed.
> 
> [Her aunt] said the detective, whose last name she recalls is McWilliams, came to her home on Monday, Oct. 2, shortly after he said her niece’s body was found in a secluded section of Marvin Gaye Park.
> 
> The park, which a Blade reporter visited on Oct. 16, consists of a long, narrow wooded area with a creek running in the middle with trees and bushes, park benches, a nature trail, and fitness equipment located throughout the park.
> 
> According to [her aunt], Det. McWilliams said police think Skylar may have died from a drug overdose, but he didn’t say how police came to that possible conclusion. Hailes said the detective’s graphic description of what he saw after park employees initially found the body and called police leads her to believe her niece did not die from a drug overdose, even though she may have occasionally used drugs.
> 
> “Her dress was up over her head off her body, her hand was over her genitals, her breasts were exposed,” [she] said the detective told her. “I have a history with drugs myself,’ [she] said. “I’m not bragging about it, but I’ve ODed myself,” she told the Blade, adding that the circumstances surrounding the body of her niece made it unlikely if not impossible that the cause of death was a drug overdose.
> 
> “How was she outside partially naked?” [she said]. “How was she there with her dress over her head and her tits exposed and her hand over her genital area? That does not happen when you OD,” she said, adding that someone experiencing an overdose loses consciousness and could not take off their clothes.
> 
> “And the way my niece was found, it was a hate crime,” [she] said, pointing to additional details she said the police detective told her. “Her purse, her phone, her credit cards, all of that stuff was gone.”
> 
> And, according to [her], the detective also told her investigators could not find any footprints from the tennis shoes Skylar was wearing on the muddy ground along the path leading to where she was found.
> 
> As if that were not enough, [she] said Skylar, who was gainfully employed at the time of her death, never hung out at Marvin Gaye Park, which has a reputation of being a place where transgender sex workers sometimes congregate. She said she went to the park a short time after her niece’s death and showed photos of Skylar to the people who were hanging out in the park. None of them said they recognized Skylar as among those who hang out at Marvin Gaye Park. 

In January 2024 the D.C. Office of the Chief Medical Examiner announced that Skylar died from an overdose.

Subsequently Antonio Currin, 29, was arrested and charged with her murder after video footage captured his car speeding away from the scene.

> Chyna, you should be here. Every time I speak your name, I feel like I’m not doing enough, that I never could. I want our Black trans sisters to live freely, to be revered for embracing transformation, for defying the stifling boxes of essentialism. We are grand possibility models, but we also deserve our humanity. We are not satellites floating isolated in some dark sky; we are tethered to those around us. We have loved ones, families, and friends.

I will carry your name on my tongue and your legacy on my shoulders. I will keep wondering who you could’ve been if the world had loved you the way you deserved.

Their spouse [Yoli](https://everloved.com/life-of/yolanda-yoli-abreu/obituary/) had passed away on Monday 2nd January.

> Christopher Alexander Velazquez, known to their loved ones as Cris, died of their own volition at home on October 12, 2023, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, at the age of 37. Born on January 24, 1986 in Newark, DE, Cris was a vastly charming individual who made a significant impact on the lives of the people around them, regardless of the length of the relationships. This holds true whether they had spoken with someone just once, or had known them for years.
> 
> Cris is survived by their beloved dogs, Mishka and Moriarty, and their cat, Maeve. They are survived by a great number of friends, chosen family members, and members of their biological family, all of whom do and will continue to sincerely miss them. Cris was preceded in death by their spouse, Yoli Abreu. Their absence will be keenly felt by those who loved them.
> 
> Cris possessed so many beautiful attributes. Their amiable disposition, smart wit and can-do spirit are well-known. Always seeking new experiences, their adventurous spirit drove them to take many different courses in life. Cris led a full life, and those who were lucky enough to know them could find joy in their loyalty, their creativity,  their mischievous humor, their dance and movement, and their compassion. 
> 
> Having served in the US Marine Corps from 2004 to 2012, Cris very well knew the costs of war. Their military association was an integral part of their life, and they spent many years openly discussing the harm of military service, in collaboration with other anti-war veterans, allies, and accomplices, often in conversation with young people. They were incredibly dedicated to making the world a kinder and more just place, with hopes of abolishing war, and educating others about the correlations between militarism and climate crisis. 
> 
> Cris lived many lives, and wore many different hats. They dedicated significant time and energy towards Gamers for Peace as part of Veterans for Peace. Cris frequently found themself in leadership positions, whether as a store manager, sports club manager, personal trainer, in service to other Disabled American Veterans, or in organizing efforts. They also worked in film, and a variety of other venues over the course of their life. 
> 
> Cris will be remembered for their commitment to making a difference, their curious and playful spirit, their loyalty and ability to put others needs before their own (often to a fault), their ability to find whimsy in the darkness, their nerdery, their desire to always grow and learn, and their tireless hope and rage channeled to building a world in which people do not have to fight to survive. Their presence is, and will continue to be, deeply missed. They are so much more loved than they could have ever known, and their memory will be cherished by so many of those whose lives they touched.

In December 2021 Cris had [spoken out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wln_a9kWli0) about their work with Veterans for Peace opposing the military using gaming to try to entice young people to enlist.

They established and operated Private Protection Division LLC in Gary as well as Hondo IV Lawncare & Snow Removal LLC.
> 
> Dominic’s social media is filled with Chicago sports teams and athletes, political figures, Tyler Perry movies, and their favorite tv shows.
> 
> Thus, we sadly acknowledge Dominic as the 32nd trans or gender nonconforming person whose violent death has been reported in 2023. They are the 24th trans person of color and the 17th Black person.  Dominic is the third gender nonconforming person this year. A trans person has been killed in the US every 8.9 days in 2023. “Reported” is an important distinction to make as we know there are more folx whose deaths remain unacknowledged. In fact, we have included two unidentified people whose remains were discovered this year.
> 
> Rest in power, Dominic. Your industrious nature, your willingness to embrace your truth, and your love for so many pieces of your life are examples of how you will be remembered. You deserved all of the years to grow into your adult life. I am very sorry that we failed to create a safe world for you.

The hypocrisy that sustains our fragile democracy in cities is burying our dreams. More than organizing anger, we need a power project that defends, recognizes & creates existential mechanisms of all life forms with dignity, happiness & prosperity.

Video surveillance footage shows her killer fleeing the scene with a gun in his hand.

> NORTHWEST MIAMI DADE, Florida. – There is no indication that a trans woman killed in northwest Miami-Dade on Monday was the victim of a hate crime. However, friends, family and maybe even police may know who killed London Price and that person can be seen on surveillance video moments after the fatal shooting.
> 
> The subject is seen fleeing the crime scene, not far from the crime scene, an apartment on Northwest 93rd Street, with a gun in his hand.
> 
> Nedra Allen said the victim who was shot and killed was her 26-year-old niece.
> 
> Allen said Price was a trans woman. Miami-Dade police officers have not confirmed the name of the victim, only identifying Price as a man who was shot and killed in broad daylight.
> 
> “She would give you the shirt she is wearing. That's what put her in the position to hurt her,"" Allen said.
> 
> According to her family, the “situation” is that of her ex, who had moved back into the apartment with her. They mention it out loud and in heartbroken posts on social media. Local 10 News is not naming anyone as police have not made any arrests or named any persons of interest.
> 
> “[She] changed [her] name, changed [her] passport, went to court and did everything the right way,” Allen said of Price's transition.
> 
> Local 10 News knocked on the doors of the apartments surrounding Price's home, but there were no answers. No one in the main house responded who could corroborate and compare whether the person in the video is the same person Price loved, with whom she lived, and for whom she may have paid a terrible price.
> 
> The man in question has had run-ins with the law in the past, according to criminal records, but detectives are not saying whether they are focused on him.
> 
> Local 10 News is working to learn more about this case.
