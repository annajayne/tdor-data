> What’s most evident is how fiercely Codii’s friends loved him. That emanates from every post, every comment, and more. They are protective of his memory and legacy now, but scrolling back through his public content shows just how deep those ties were forged.

> Rest in power, Codii. Your light was bright and touched many people. You deserved a safer world with years of opportunities and experiences. I hope we can find that world for you and others. Thank you for all that you brought to this world.

You Only Know One shortly became a mantra reinforcing ideas of self preservation, self worth, and understanding of the only constant in my life: the state of your ever changing self. Freshly stuck in the throes of a world outside of my control, armed with a large black pickup truck, all of my plants, and all of my art supplies with a whole new form to fill the shoes of, and of course, very, very confused, I left behind a life of struggle and started pursuing my art career very, very seriously.

They were shot in front of their home in what appears to have been a targeted execution.

> Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) — A popular Iraqi TikTok personality was shot dead on Monday in Baghdad, an Iraqi security source told CNN.
> 
> Known on social media as “Noor BM,” 23-year-old Noor Alsaffar had over 370,000 followers collectively on Instagram and TikTok. Alsaffar mostly posted short videos showing dresses, hair and makeup styles, often dancing to music. Following news of the shooting, many posted comments lamenting Alsaffar’s death. Some others cheered it, celebrating the man who fired the shot.
> 
> The Iraqi security source told CNN that “an investigation has been opened,” speaking on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak to the media. “The deceased has been taken to the forensic department.”
> 
> Khaled Almehna, spokesperson for the Iraqi police, described the attack as a “criminal incident” on Tuesday, adding that he will provide “important updates” at a later time.
> 
> The killing comes as Iraq cracks down on LGBTQ expression and moves to criminalize it in law. While being queer is not explicitly banned under current Iraqi legislation, LGBTQ people are often targeted under vague morality clauses in its penal code.
> 
> Before the shooting, Alsaffar faced online abuse, as well as questions about sexuality and gender. In a 2020 interview on Iraq’s Al Walaa channel, Alsaffar said: “I’m not transgender and I’m not gay. I don’t have other tendencies, I’m only a cross-dresser and a model.” Alsaffar identified as male who worked as a model and makeup artist.

Note that how Noor identified at the time of their death is not entirely clear. [One report](https://www.albawaba.com/node/iraqi-trans-blogger-shot-dead-baghdad-1535647) claimed they had recently come out as transgender.

Noor's Instagram profile was https://www.instagram.com/norbmmw/. The account has since been cleaned, and is now completely empty.

> Jaipur: The Jaipur police on Sunday arrested three persons for allegedly killing a 25-year-old transgender woman and setting her body on fire in Kanota.
> The Jaipur police have identified the accused as Naresh Kumar alias Narsi (33), Suneel Bhaat (22), and Suraj Meena (19).
> 
> The police have identified a failed love affair as the primary motive behind the murder of the victim, Neelu (25). Her partially burned body was discovered in Kanota on Friday.
> In their statements on Sunday, the police revealed that Kumar and Neelu had been in a relationship for the past five years. However, Naresh had grown suspicious of Neelu's involvement with another person, which had angered him.
> 
> The police also discovered that the two had frequent quarrels. On Thursday, when all four of them were travelling in a car, an argument escalated, leading to Kumar punching Neelu in the face. Neelu began bleeding and was in pain. Subsequently, the accused used a small rope from a dholak to strangle her and then placed her body in the trunk of their car.
> The accused then obtained five litres of petrol in a jerrican, which they used to pour onto the victim's body before setting her on fire.
> 
> According to the police, the victim's body was severely burnt, with over 90 per cent of it consumed by the fire, leaving only a portion of the face recognizable. “This made it challenging for the police to identify the victim. Consequently, the police issued a search request throughout Rajasthan and published a photo of the deceased in newspapers,” said the statement.
> 
> The police also reviewed CCTV footage from the incident site, the main market, petrol pumps, and toll booths. Through the analysis of CCTV footage and information gathered from informants across the city, the police identified the victim and arrested the accused.

> 
> Transsexuality is not a mania, it is not an illness. Transsexuality still occurs in the mother's womb, where when the fetus is formed there is a communication failure between the brain and the identity of the genitals. More specifically, Sofia's brain, still in her mother's womb, gave her a female identity, her body failed and made her a boy.

> It was 18 years of feeling like a girl, seeing herself as a girl and looking in the mirror with pain and unimaginable suffering.

> But unfortunately, Sofia almost fulfilled a destiny that is set for all these people who, unfortunately, are born this way and cannot bear the pain of what the mirror shows them. Sofia, like many transgender people, ended her life. It is important that we look at this, it is important that we be aware, this is not a mania, this is not a mental illness. This is life. Our life is the life of those we love. If we can all look at these people with more love, we can avoid this end for many Sofias who are out there in hiding, ashamed and in pain.
