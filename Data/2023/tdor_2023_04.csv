> The case took place on March 11 in Itabuna, in southern Bahia, when José Carlos, in the midst of a fight, threw alcohol and set the victim on fire. The woman, who was transsexual, was at the Hospital de Base Luiz Eduardo Magalhães, visiting her hospitalized father, and went to see her ex outside the premises.

Karla had recently been separated from José, but who she still kept in touch. However, the criminal was possessive and told the circle of friends that she did not accept her breakup and that she would return to him, regardless of the circumstances.

She was a trans woman of the Pemona ethnic group, originally from the state of Bolívar who worked as a hairdresser and made crafts.

> Refusing to leave Tucupita, Delta Amacuro state, until she was honest and consolidated her love relationship, she slowly dug her own grave.
> 
> According to rumors from former prisoners, Ántoni Medina Lezama, 34, alias “Pemona” by virtue of his origin, died in a massacre in the jungle of Villa Bolivariana, Tucupita municipality, along with two other people.
> 
> Among the bones found were hers. It is presumed that she may have hidden “merchandise” stolen from a minor drug trafficker, paying for it with her life.


La Pemona has previously been confined for 6 years in the Guasina Police Detention and Protection Center.

> Her confinement lasted six years. One of them, under the prison government of the “Taliban”, suffering an intense and unspeakable martyrdom, until the light came on and he was able to [leave] the Guasina Police Retention and Protection Center in Tucupita.
> 
> [Deadname] Lezama, 32 years old, is a Pemon indigenous native of Santa Elena de Uairén, Bolívar state. From a very young age she felt within herself an intense sensation of being in the wrong body and decided to carve herself, progressively, to the extent possible, a woman's figure by refining her features and polishing her manners.
> 
> Grateful for life, offering her energies and her being to the Almighty in return for the second chance she was given, she wants to leave behind certain attitudes and behaviors of her youthful past. “I was too rebellious with my loved ones, today I am different, I want to show them that I have changed and make them forget those moments.”
> 
> “I have learned to forgive, to have mercy on everyone, just as God has mercy on me. Whatever they do against me, I forgive them and give them my hand,” she revealed.

Smith documentary ""[Kokomo City](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt22528178/)"", and a rapper who had released two singles.

> Rasheeda Williams, a Black trans woman and performing artist better known by her stage names Koko Da Doll and Hollywood Koko, was shot and killed in Atlanta, GA on Wednesday night. She was 35 years old.
> 
> According to reporting in Gaye Magazine, Atlanta police have confirmed that a person was shot on the corner of Martin Luther King Jr. Dr. SW and Hamilton E. Holmes NW late Wednesday. Police sources did not confirm Williams’ identity, but friends and family stated that she was the victim in social media posts obtained by the magazine. No details about the killing have been made public at this time.
> 
> Williams’ violent death was also confirmed in an Instagram post by LGBTQ+ advocate Daniella Carter, with whom Williams starred in filmmaker D. Smith’s latest documentary Kokomo City. “I’m truly at a lost of words and in deep pain,” Carter wrote, sharing an image of Williams on the red carpet at the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year.
> 
> In addition to being a trans sex worker, which she discussed at length in Kokomo City, Williams was a rapper, releasing her first single “Trick” in 2020 followed by 2022’s “Bulletproof.” She was also working on new music, as she teased in a vlog last year.
> 
> “Koko had a heart of gold and spread nothing but love and light to those she came across,” Williams’ family wrote in the description of their GoFundMe campaign to pay for funeral costs. “To know Koko is to love her, she loved her family and friends to the core of her heart.” At time of writing, the campaign had raised roughly half of its $15,000 goal.
> 
> Williams’ death marks at least the tenth violent killing of a trans person in the U.S. this year, per numbers maintained by Pittsburgh Lesbian Correspondents. Her murder comes less than two weeks after Ashley Burton was also shot to death in Atlanta. No arrests in that case have been made public. And in January, Georgia state police shot nonbinary activist Tortuguita — who was protesting the development of a police training facility colloquially called “Cop City” — at least 57 times.

Jermarcus Jernigan, 17, was subsequently arrested in connection with her murder.

> ATLANTA — Atlanta police have arrested and charged a 17-year-old in the shooting death of a transgender woman last week.
> 
> Police said they responded to 2400 block of Martin Luther King Drive in Southwest Atlanta on April 18 to a person shot call. When they arrived, they found Koko Williams dead from a gunshot wound.
> 
> Officials say 17-year-old Jermarcus Jernigan turned himself in to police yesterday and he was taken to the Fulton County Jail.
> 
> Jernigan has been charged with murder, aggravated assault and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony.

The trailer for Kokomo City was released in early August 2023.

He had been involved with the nonprofit Young Women's Freedom Centre since he was 12.

Police arrested the security guard before releasing him without charge. When the video of the confrontation in which Banko died was released. the refusal to bring charges caused a public outcry.

> Banko Brown, a 24-year-old Black trans man, is the most recent reported victim of anti-trans violence after he was fatally shot by a security guard in a San Francisco Walgreens. Banko used the surnames Brown and Paso.
> 
> At approximately 6:33 p.m., SFPD officers from Tenderloin Station responded to a report of a shooting at 825 Market Street near Fourth Street, the SFPD reported. Officers arrived on scene and located a victim – identified as 24-year-old Chynna Brown, who preferred the name Banko Paso – suffering from a gunshot wound. Officers rendered aid and summoned medics to the scene. Paso was transported to a nearby hospital with life-threatening injuries and was later pronounced dead.
> 
> Young Women’s Freedom Center, a San Francisco nonprofit that provides support for young women and  trans youth of all genders, identified Banko as a community organizing intern for the nonprofit. He had been involved with the organization since he was just 12 years old and was currently serving as a community organizing intern. His work involves street assessments of folx during the pandemis.
> 
> Julia Arroyo, co-executive director of the Young Women’s Freedom Center, said. “He reached my heart. He really did reach my heart. He was so funny and he was bold too, he knew what he was striving for.”
> 
> The organization set up a crowdfund for Banko’s funeral expenses. It reads, in part:
> 
> Banko had also struggled with housing instability for over a decade. He worked tirelessly, making consistent calls for shelter and other basic needs. Still, instead of receiving the support he needed, at every turn, there were obstacles and endless hoops to jump through. He was criminalized and lost his life trying to survive.
> 
> Banko has been repeatedly misgendered by media. The same media that’s debating the issue of shoplifting as an epidemic rather than examining the reasons people turn to shoplifting. Or the epidemic of violence decimating the trans community. One person interviewed said the guard was probably “overwhelmed” which I think is a staffing/personnel issue, not a reason to shoot anyone. 
> 
> The problem isn’t shoplifting, no matter the cost to the economy. The cost of young people entering adulthood without housing or adequate resources to meet their daily needs is much greater for our economy. The cost of killing shoplifters is inconceivable.
> 
> The point is not how to curb shoplifting without resorting to lethal force – that should be a given – but how to reduce the reality that young people feel a need to shoplift for survival.
> 
> “We need immediate funding for community-based housing that responds to what young people want for themselves. Instead of terrorizing and killing youth, we need real investment into their safety.”   
> 
> According to his social media profile, Banko was interested in Eastern spirituality. He was looking forward to the next Olympics. These are things we should be celebrating about this young man – his service to the community, his efforts to save himself, his interests and passions. He shared some intensely personal and painful feelings about his family of origin, including his deep devotion to his beloved grandmother, raging that she had no headstone. I hope someone makes sure Banko and his grandmother have a headstone. That’s the very least we can do. Honor his wish.
