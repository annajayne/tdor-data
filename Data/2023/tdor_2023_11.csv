They and their partner were both found dead in their home with stab wounds on Monday 13th November.

Subsequently the authorities concluded that Ociel was killed by their partner, Dorien Herrera.

> The lead prosecutor investigating the killing of Jesús Ociel Baena, Mexico’s first nonbinary magistrate, said they were not the victim of a hate crime but were instead brutally slain in a razor blade murder-suicide at the hands of their lawyer and model boyfriend, Dorian Herrera.
>  
> The bloodied bodies of Baena, 38, and Herrera, 37, were discovered earlier this month at their home in the central Mexico city of Aguascalientes. The bodies were found at the base of the stairs of their two-story home. Baena had suffered 20 stab wounds from what has been described as a razor blade. They had defensive wounds to the arms and hands, but the fatal blow was a gash to the jugular. Herrera was found lying next to Baena, having suffered a gash to his jugular. Investigators say he had wounds to his hands and fingers consistent with the use of a razor in a fight.
> 
> Baena was a leading figure in Mexico’s LGBTQ+ community and was granted a special security detail due to receiving multiple death threats. Many initially suspected the two men were the victims of a hate crime, but the state prosecutor said all the evidence at the scene, including the wounds to the bodies, pointed to a murder-suicide at the hands of Herrera.
> 
> Ortega told Radio Formula that investigators believe a fight began in the upstairs bedroom and that Herrera attacked Baena with a blade, as evidenced by the state of the bed and the pattern of bloodstains. They say Herrera followed Baena downstairs, where he continued to slash the judge before killing them with a gash to the neck. Ortega said investigators believe Herrera went back upstairs to retrieve a knife, came back downstairs, lay next to Baena, and then slit his own throat.
> 
> “We found footprints, left and right, that go downstairs, and we figure he went back upstairs for another blade, which he used to cut his own throat, causing the loss of his life,” Figueroa told Radio Formula. “Both bodies were on the ground floor of the house, just centimeters from one another.”
> 
> Ortega also said investigators have reviewed video surveillance footage that shows the couple arriving home and entering the front door around 1:15 a.m. the day of the killings and roughly eight hours before the bodies were discovered. He said the front door was locked, that no one else was observed entering the residence, and that there was no evidence of another person other than Baena and Herrera at the scene.

> Unidentified assailants shot dead Alisha, also known as [ deadname], a transgender residing in Dakoha at Ekta Nagar in Rama Mandi late on Monday night. The motive behind the murder is believed to stem from a longstanding rivalry between two transgender groups.
> 
> As per the information available, armed individuals entered [Alisha]'s residence and fired two shots that hit [them] in the back. He was immediately rushed to Johal Hospital in Rama Mandi, where despite treatment, [they] succumbed to [their] wounds.
> 
> Expressing their outrage, fellow transgenders staged a roadblock outside the hospital seeking action against the alleged perpetrators of the crime.
> 
> They claimed to have filed a death threat complaint on October 28 with the Surya Enclave police against Billa and his associates, whom they accused of Rohit’s murder. The protesters criticised the police for not taking timely action, asserting that their negligence allowed the accused to carry out fatal attack on Monday night.
> 
> In response to the mounting pressure, police registered a complaint on Monday night against Gagan Arora, Billa, Pawan and other unidentified individuals under various sections of the IPC and relevant sections of the Arms Act. The search for the accused extended late into the night, resulting in the detention of Gagan Arora on Tuesday morning.

> Confirming the arrest, ACP Central Nirmal Singh revealed that the victim had previously worked with the accused group but parted ways a few months back.

> 
> ACP Nirmal Singh said the police had formed multiple teams and were conducting raids to apprehend those involved in the incident.

> A trans woman died after being stabbed in the throat in the center of Curitiba. The case happened after the victim had an encounter with a man on Tuesday night (14).
> 
> According to the Civil Police, witnesses stated that she had gone out with a man hours before being attacked. After being stabbed in the throat, she apparently tried to run to escape: “There are some drops of blood approximately 100 meters from here, which indicates that she was attacked in a location other than where she fell,” say the police.
> 
> The crime was recorded on Rua Alameda Cabral on the corner of Avenida Princesa Isabel. Subsequently, employees of a bar in the region called the Military Police (PM). Siate was also called to help the victim.
> 
> The police stated that what is known so far is that the victim had claimed that she was going out to meet a man and was later found dead. She was stabbed in the throat.
> 
> The woman lived close to the crime scene and worked in a beauty salon in Curitiba. The victim was already unconscious when security teams arrived and, a moment later, she succumbed to her injuries.

A month after Isabely's murder a man was charged with femicide.

> Subsequently The Public Ministry of Paraná, through the 5th Public Prosecutor's Office for Intentional Crimes against Life, filed a complaint for qualified homicide against a man who stabbed a woman to death in Curitiba on the night of November 14 of this year. The crime, classified as feminicide, was motivated by transphobia – intolerance to the victim's gender identity, who was a trans woman.
>
> In the complaint, the Public Prosecutor's Office points out that the attacks began after the defendant refused to pay the amount of R$600 for the sexual program provided by the woman, who said she would insead charge for it by disclosing the intimate relationship that occurred between them.
>
> The vile motive, consisting of transphobia, the use of a resource that made it difficult to defend the victim, and feminicide, as it was committed due to the victim's female sex, were identified as qualifiers.

Her killer, 25-year-old Damarean Bible, was arrested at his apartment and charged with murder.

>  Family, community, and members of the Queer Legislative Caucus gathered at the State Capitol on Thursday to mourn the recent killing of a transgender woman of color, and pledge action on transphobia and violence against LGBTQ people. 
> 
>  Damarean Kaylon Bible, 25, has been arrested on suspicion of shooting Savannah Ryan Williams, 38, near Lake Street in Minneapolis on Nov. 29, killing her, according to court records. 
>  
>  The news has rocked the queer community in Minneapolis. 
>  
>  “We’re all still processing. It’s kind of surreal that we lost one of our sisters last week,” said Amber Muhm, an HIV outreach and prevention specialist with the Aliveness Project. 
>  
>  Muhm co-leads the Tea Time support network for trans women and femmes, which Williams was part of, and the situation has devastated their small community.  
>  
>  “Savannah was fierce, full of life. She had a big personality and an even bigger heart. She’s going to be dearly, dearly missed,” Muhm said. 
>  
>  Courtney Mason said he and Williams had been married for seven years, and he cherished her because “she was a very loving, caring person.” She loved having fun, watching movies, and listening to slow love songs by artists like Beyonce and Drake, according to Mason. 
>  
>  Gabrielle Stillday said her older sister would insist on giving the shoes off her feet, and was the favorite auntie to her nieces and nephews.
>  
>  “I just would like the world to know that Savannah meant the world to me and my kids. She would give me her last and she was very loved by our family,” she said. 
>  
>  Her cousin Rae Lynn Stillday choked up at the press conference. 
>  
> “Although we are so sad that she is gone and heartbroken, the love, the laugh, the memories she gave will live on forever in our hearts.” 
> 
> ‘Anti-trans violence is an epidemic’ 
> 
> Rep. Leigh Finke, DFL-St. Paul, was among many on Thursday calling the attack a hate crime and denouncing anti-trans sentiments in state and national politics. Though Minnesota became a “trans refuge” state earlier this year with the passage of several bills intended to protect trans communities, advocates said it’s not enough. 
> 
> “Anti-trans violence is an epidemic. It is everywhere,” said Finke, who is the first openly transgender person to ever serve in the Minnesota Legislature. “Our communities will not be safe until every one of our neighbors sees our humanity, celebrates our individuality, and embraces this beautiful community that loves and is worthy of love.” 
> 
> The Queer Caucus called for more legislation to ensure trans people’s safety, including investments into equity programs in housing, jobs and support systems.  
> 
> The incident is the second known violent attack on a trans woman in Minneapolis in 2023. Two men pled guilty to attacking a transgender woman at the Lake Street light rail station in February. The Hennepin County Attorney’s Office at the time said it did not seek hate crime sentencing enhancements because there was no evidence anti-trans bias motivated the men.  
> 
> This in addition to the mass shooting on a Minneapolis punk house show in August that killed one and injured six. The venue was known to be welcoming to LGBTQ+ people and several survivors who were shot are LGBTQ+. No arrests have been made in that case, but the Office said a senior attorney was recently assigned to help Minneapolis police investigate the shooting. 
> 
> The last known killing of a trans woman in Minnesota was in 2011, when a man admitted to stabbing Krissy Bates in her Minneapolis apartment. However, a record 59 trans and gender-nonconforming people were killed across the U.S. in 2021, according to the Human Rights Campaign. At least 41 were killed in 2022, and at least 26 have been killed so far this year. Data estimates are expected to underrepresent fatalities because trans identities are often unreported or mis-reported. 
> 
> That violence disproportionately affects people of color; they made up 84 percent of victims of violence against transgender and gender non-conforming people in 2021, according to the Human Rights Campaign. Family members said Williams was Cuban and Native American, descended from the Red Lake Nation. 
> 
> Native American women are also more likely to be victims of violent crime. Native American women make up less than 1 percent of the state’s population, but homicide rates for Native women were seven times higher than for white women between 1990 and 2016. 
> 
> The state and federal governments seek to address these disparities in part with the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Missing and Murdered African American Women taskforces. 
> 
> Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty said in a statement on Thursday that it is possible a bias-motivated sentencing enhancement, frequently called a “hate crime,” could be added in the case. Bible is currently facing one charge of second-degree murder. However, officials are still investigating. 
> 
> “While we cannot get into specific details, we can commit to doing what we do in every case, which is to do everything in our power to understand the facts and prosecute the case appropriately. If the investigation reveals sufficient evidence to prove bias motivation beyond a reasonable doubt, we would prosecute accordingly,” Moriarty said. 
> 
> Prosecutors can add these sentencing enhancements to increase the minimum and maximum sentences for crimes proven to be motivated by bias against certain identities. Those identity groups include a victim’s actual or perceived race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, disability, age or national origin. 
> 
> ‘Please don’t judge her’ 
> 
> According to court records, police found Williams dead in a courtyard on Fourth Avenue South near Lake Street in Minneapolis on Wednesday, Nov. 29. Surveillance video shows Williams and Bible walking towards the area around 5 a.m. and Bible walking away alone after about 45 minutes, according to a probable cause statement police filed in court. 
> 
> Bible told investigators he was walking past a bus shelter on Lake Street when Williams asked if he wanted to have sex. He agreed and walked towards the courtyard with her. He said Williams made him “suspicious,” so after the sex act was done he shot her point blank in the head. 
> 
> From jail, Bible told his father that he “just murdered someone.” He said he felt sorry for killing, but he “had to do it,” according to police. 
> 
> It’s not clear from the police report what Bible was suspicious of. 
> 
> However, Gabrielle Stillday does not believe her sister was killed because of her gender expression.  
> 
> “She was murdered because Bible was curious, or should we use word ‘suspicious,’ from the beginning to the end,” she said. 
> 
> “You all … out there need to open your hearts and be willing to look past her past mistakes and judge her off her beautiful soul, and known she was a loving and kind person. Savannah is our superstar. Do you have a superstar? If you answered yes, please don't judge her cause she wouldn’t judge you."" 

Bible was convicted in August 2024. The following month he was sentenced to 30 years and 6 months for second degree murder.
