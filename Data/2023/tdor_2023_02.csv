The shooter - a man who worked for the same company - has been arrested.

> LOUISVILLE, Ky. — The woman shot and killed outside the JB Swift (JBS) plant in Butchertown Friday was identified by the Jefferson County Coroner as Imanitwitaho Zachee, though her friends just called her ""Zachee.""
> 
> A coworker of Zachee, who asked WHAS11 News not to share her name, told us Zachee always had a smile on her face. ""She was always happy. Always walking down the hallways smiling,"" Zachee's coworker said. ""Even when she knew they were talking about her, she didn't care. She was always happy.""
> 
> The coworker described her shock to hear that Zachee was shot and killed in the JBS parking lot. She was working on the line inside JBS when she was informed of the tragedy and ran outside to see LMPD and a black barrier around Zachee’s body.
> 
> ""She was a very kind person, always loving people and helping people,"" Zachee's close friend, Eric Semuhungu, said. ""I was like 'who does that?' My mind was blowing up. May she rest in peace.""
> 
> Edilberto Lores-Reyes, 58, has been charged with Zachee's murder after police said he went to the jail and confessed. LMPD's Matt Sanders said he was taken in by detectives with the department's Homicide Unit and interviewed. The citation said the gun used in the shooting was inside Lores-Reyes' vehicle which was parked outside Metro Corrections.
> 
> Employees at JBS informed police both the suspect and victim were employed at the facility. Police say surveillance video captured the shooting. Lores-Reyes has not been charged with a hate crime. However, the employee and friend of Zachee we spoke with said it should be considered, ""Because everyone knew she was [transgender].""
> 
> While we don't know what lead the shooter to kill Zachee. We are learning more about her.
>
Zachee's coworker, and additional people who knew her, tell WHAS11 News she was born and lived in Rwanda before coming to the United States. Semuhungu said all Zachee wanted in life was to be truly herself. ""I hope she gets justice because no one deserves that,"" he said. ""She came to America, the land of opportunity, for a better life. Sadly, she didn't make it.""

Police arrested him at the scene.

> This Tuesday the Mossos d'Esquadra arrested a man accused of killing his partner in Barcelona. The victim, who was known in the Sant Martí neighborhood as Sandra, lived as a woman despite the fact that her identity documents [were in her deadname]. The couple had a history of abuse, according to police sources. The residents of the gigantic social block of the Barcelona City Council, on carrer de la Selva de Mar, confirmed that fights were common on the tenth floor apartment where they had lived for at least a year.
> 
> When the Catalan police arrived at the property after 10 in the morning, they found Sandra badly injured with various stab wounds. Her partner, José María, 52, has been arrested by the Mossos and she died shortly after. Neighbors say that the night before, Sandra asked the tenants on her landing for help after a new fight with her partner , who lives with mental health problems that caused him to be periodically admitted to hospitals. ""He's going to kill me,"" they say Sandra repeated on several occasions.
> 
> ""You could see it coming,"" lamented Manuel Olivares, the concierge of the building, where more than 130 families reside, divided into two stairs. The comings and goings of the couple of Sandra and José María were constant. ""She told him that if she lived alone she would be better off,"" laments the man. The same story is repeated among all those who knew the couple. Sometimes dressed in a skirt, but mostly in tracksuits and casual clothes, Sandra identified as a woman even though she had not physically undergone [reassignment surgery]. ""And woe to you if you referred to her as a man,"" say the workers at the nearby pharmacy where they knew both of them.
> 
> “If she called herself Sandra, introduced herself as Sandra and claimed to be Sandra, she is Sandra. There is no need to think about it any more,"" said Carla Antonelli, who does not doubt that the case should be treated as sexist violence, regardless of whether Sandra responded ""to the stereotype of a woman."" ""Or perhaps she is she less of a woman before someone gets the first hormone?"" Asks the well-known trans activist. And she cites a circular from the Prosecutor's Office from 2011 where she assures that cases that affect transsexual women must be dealt with by courts specialized in sexist violence.

Two teenagers were convicted of her murder and sentenced to life.

> A teenage girl described as a ""lovely kid"" was stabbed to death in a park in Warrington - leading police forensics and dog teams to scour open fields in a Cheshire village.
> 
> Brianna Ghey, 16, was found dead by members of the public on a path in Culcheth's Linear Park, popular with dog-walkers, by members of the public at around 3.13pm Saturday (February 11). She had spoken to her mum earlier that day, but detectives said it was ""too early to say"" what the teenager was doing in the area and whether she had been to meet anyone.
> 
> A gymnastics coach, who knew the Birchwood High School pupil when she was slightly younger, told the ECHO: ""She used to come into the gym in the school and do gymnastics with us, she was a lovely kid.""
> 
> A TikTok account belonging to Brianna with 11,000 followers showed her dancing and lip-syncing to music, and dancing in a park, although it was unclear whether it was the same area where she was found dead. Her final video was posted only hours before she died.
> 
> Brianna was killed in a ""targeted attack"" and there was ""no wider risk to the public"" according to Detective Chief Superintendent Mike Evans, of Cheshire Police. However DCS Evans said he could not elaborate further other than to say the force was following ""multiple lines of enquiry"". Residents in the quiet estates surrounding the park expressed their shock at the sight of an air ambulance followed by ""armed police"" in the area around the park yesterday.

Brianna had transitioned several months before she died. In a final indignity, her death certificate will misgender her because she was too young to apply for a gender recognition certificate.

> According to reports, Ghey had socially transitioned a number of months before her death, and had been on the receiving end of transphobic abuse for years. But due to Ghey's age and the British legal process for officially changing one's gender, it is expected that her sex will automatically be recorded as male on her death certificate. In the UK, a person needs to be 18, diagnosed with gender dysphoria, and have been living in their affirmed gender for at least two years in order to get a Gender Recognition Certificate. The certificate, which updates a person's birth certificate, also ensures they have the correct gender marker on their death certificate. Ghey, who was only 16, would not have met the requirements set out by the UK government.
>
> That Ghey is likely to be misgendered on her death certificate has sparked fury among LGBTQ activists, with several telling Insider that it is an indignity for her, and a reflection of draconian laws. ""She's not even going to be afforded basic dignity in her death,"" said Katy Montgomerie, a feminist and trans activist, during a call with Insider. ""Every trans child who dies is forced to go through this, which is pointlessly cruel,"" she added.

On Thursday 20th July one of two teenagers accused of murdering her pleaded not guilty. The other did not enter a plea. Both were convicted in December 2023, and in February 2024 Scarlett Jenkinson and Eddie Ratcliffe, both 16, were named as Brianna's killers. Jenkinson was sentenced to life with a minimum of 22 years and Ratcliffe to life with a minimum of 20 years.

The judge noted that both took part in a “brutal, planned murder” that was “sadistic in nature” and motivated by “hostility towards Brianna because of her transgender identity.”

Although Brianna's TikTok account has been deleted, her videos have been archived at https://www.tiktok.com/@gingerpuppyx_videos.

> February 13, 2023. On the night of Saturday, February 11, 2023, the streets of Barranquilla were filled with joy and brightness to celebrate that people with sexual orientations, gender identities and expressions continue to build carnival culture year after year, meeting in spaces for socialization and joy.
> 
> However, at the end of this day, the streets that should be a permanent safe space for LGBTIQ+ people once again became a scene of violence. This 22-year-old person with a trans life experience, nicknamed 'Chichi' or 'La Pájara' by her loved ones, was returning to her home in the Las Malvinas neighborhood after La Guacherna when she was shot eight times and stabbed twice by an unidentified person. Her mother, Darcely Niebles, declared that she had no enemies and that demands justice so that her death does not go unpunished.
> 
> Her community and family have also supported this demand, since 'Chichi' was a fundamental person in his environment remembered for his joy. The brutality in this crime may be an indication of a bias-motivated murder. From Caribe Afirmativo we express our concern that not even the spaces that should be safer for LGBTIQ+ people have effective guarantees for our lives and safety.
> 
> In 2022, six murders of LGBTIQ+ people were killed in Barranquilla. On the other hand, so far in 2023 two murders have been counted. We request that the Attorney General's Office quickly investigate this case, based on the possibility that it is a case of homicide motivated by prejudiced motives. We reiterate that in all the events registered against LGBTIQ+ people there must be an analysis that includes the possibility of violence due to prejudice towards people with diverse sexual orientations, identities and gender expressions.
> 
> In addition, we request that a working group be convened to analyze and take action on the facts, applying the good practice guide that we developed with the Prosecutor's Office for the investigation of this fact with a gender approach that allows establishing if they had an origin of violence. due to prejudice towards the sexual orientation, gender identity or expression of the victim.

> A 27-year-old transvestite was stabbed to death on Avenida Osório de Paiva, in the Siqueira neighborhood, in Fortaleza. The case was registered on Saturday, the 11th. For residents of the region, the crime was an ""announced tragedy"". As O POVO found out, the victim was stabbed inside a plot of land that works as a prostitution spot. In addition to darkness and abandonment, the neighborhood's complaint also relates to the illegal sale of narcotics.
> 
> The crime on Avenida Osório de Paiva took place exactly on the day that completed one year since the death of [Sofia Gisely](https://tdor.translivesmatter.info/reports/2022/02/11/sofia-gisely_fortaleza-ceara-brazil_9396057d), the victim of a homicide by stoning stones on the same avenue.
> 
> Those who need to go through the area daily fear robberies due to the lack of lighting. According to residents, the motel located next to the land is used by people who stay nearby to carry out sexual programs. And the land is also used for the same purposes.
> 
> In Saturday's case, as O POVO found out, the victim was stabbed inside the lot and fled to the entrance of the motel, but did not resist. The knife used in the crime was stuck in her chest.
> 
> A motivation was not revealed, but the neighborhood suspects a conflict over a sex program or dispute over a prostitution point. The Secretariat for Public Security and Social Defense (SSPDS), however, reported that investigations are carried out by the Department of Homicide and Personal Protection (DHPP). According to the SSPDS, the victim had a criminal record for illegally carrying a firearm and drug trafficking. The victim's name has not been released.

On Tuesday 14th March Gilvan Almeida Barbosa, 27, was arrested in connection with Luara's murder. Three other suspects are also being sought by police.

Several days earlier [Ruby Ferrer](https://tdor.translivesmatter.info/reports/2023/02/14/ruby-ferrer_carabayllo-lima-peru_8afeda0d) had been killed in similar circumstances.

> Priscila Aguado and Rubí Ferrer, trans women, died at the hands of the prostitution and quota collection mafia.
> 
> Ruby, a native of Tarapoto, was kidnapped and taken from Cercado de Lima to Avenida Santo Domingo, Asociación Las Dalias, in the district of Carabayllo. “Just so you know, did you hear? You're leaving… from that… plaza”, the murderer is heard saying, who, with one hand records and with the other he shot him 15 times at point-blank range. 9 projectiles hit the victim's body.
> 
> On February 11, Priscila Aguado, a trans woman of approximately 30 years, was riddled with 4 shots. The woman died between the limits of Chorrillos and San Juan de Miraflores in Lima. It is presumed that she tried to ask for help during the early morning. Although the media are treating the issue as a murder due to transphobia or gender discrimination, there are no concrete facts to indicate that the homicide was carried out for reasons of hatred of her [gender identity] and orientation. Likewise, preliminary police investigations indicate that the murders are related to the issue of prostitution and quota trafficking.
> 
> This does not mean that these are not two murders, which is why the LGBTIQ+ community held protests at the doors of the Alfonso Ugarte police station, demanding justice for the deceased. ""The deaths of Rubi Ferrer and Priscila Aguado cannot go unpunished, which is why we are demanding that the police attend to the complaint that was referred to Carabayllo and return to Lima, the place where they worked,"" said the spokesperson for the LGTBI collective.
> 
> Let us remember also that during the early hours of February 10, the sex worker Gladys Acuña Espinoza (58), was riddled with bullets by two alleged hit men who shot her up to six times, killing her on the spot. The event occurred in the district of Puente Piedra.

> February 19, 2023 . In the middle of the celebration of Carnival Saturday, Katia, a 47-year-old trans woman who was dedicated to fixing nails and hair at home in different neighborhoods, was murdered. The events occurred on Calle 72 with carrera 16 A, Los Cedros neighborhood, when Katia was approached by hitmen who shot and hit her at least three times, causing fatal injuries. In an interview for the Ground Zero media, a relative of the victim stated that “We do not know if the crime is due to discrimination or hated for her condition, but we want justice to be done. She was a cheerful person and very popular in the neighborhood .
> 
> This unfortunate fact constitutes the second murder of a trans woman in Atlanticó in 2023. Let us remember that during the night of the LGBTIQ+ Guacherna, on February 11, 2023, [La Pájara](https://tdor.translivesmatter.info/reports/2023/02/11/la-pajara_barranquilla-atlantico-colombia_a039d032) was murdered with two stab wounds and eight shots in the Las Malvinas neighborhood. With these, there are four murders of LGBTIQ+ people in the department of Atlántico in 2023. This should set off an alarm for the authorities, since in the entire first half of 2022 there were two homicides of LGBTIQ+ people in the department, with a total seven in the whole year. This year, in just a month and a half, more than half of the murders of the entire year 2022 have been recorded.
> 
> It is also important to take into account that the increase in violence has been exponential at the end and beginning of each year, since in the Atlantic three gay men were murdered at the end of the previous year in episodes marked by violence and cruelty. This pattern seems to continue in 2023 and must be taken into account by the Prosecutor's Office in the investigation of the facts. In addition, the entity must resort to the Guide to good practices in cases of violence against LGBTIQ+ people, taking into account the possibility that the murders of Katia and La Pájara may have been motivated by prejudice towards their gender identity.
> 
> From Caribe Afirmativo we request effective measures to protect the lives of LGBTIQ+ people from the Soledad Mayor's Office. We also reiterate the need for a table for urgent cases agreed by the Ombudsman's Office, with the participation of the Sectional Director of the Prosecutor's Office in the Atlantic, the department's women's delegate, representatives of the Judicial Police, Legal Medicine, local authorities and organizations of civil society to evaluate the progress of cases and create strategies for the prevention of violence.

> It is difficult to determine exactly what is the correct way to treat the death of Iván, the trans boy who threw himself from a balcony in Barcelona together with his twin sister, from the media. It is necessary to delve into the problems, try to put yourself in the place from which the different positions are enunciated (even when we find them unpleasant) and look at the events as part of a developing process. 
> 
> The initial news about Iván's death did not mention his transition process. We simply knew the case as the death of the Argentine ""twins"" in Barcelona as a result of bullying received within the school environment. Little by little, we learned the details and dismantled that first conglomerate of ""the twins"" to realize that each one of the siblings experienced bullying differently. We found out that both were harassed for being Argentine and for not being fluent in Catalan. 
> 
> The appearance of the letters left by Iván and his sister helped us to know that even the decision to commit suicide had nuances: Iván openly declared his weariness for the violence received and for the lack of horizons for his life, while Leila simply expressed that she wanted to accompany her sister (sic), even to the end. 
> 
> In that letter Iván used feminine pronouns to refer to himself and so did his sister when mentioning him, however, over time he revealed that he had told his intimate circle of friends that he ""felt like a boy"" and wanted to be called Iván . In fact, it was learned that his schoolmates bothered him by calling him ""Ivana"" and calling him a ""tomboy"". Thus, we learned that the bullying was not only due to his migrant status, but also to his trans identity.

Next, Beck described the deceased to be a beautiful person inside and out: “Cashay was born June 14, 1991 in Chicago, Illinois. She was a bubbly spirit with a down-to-earth, tell-it-like-it-is personality. Cashay was a transgender female and was as beautiful as can be, inside and out. Cashay didn’t deserve what happened to her.”

She was a Russian refugee who had applied for asylum in the Netherlands and had complained of long waiting times to access HRT.

> The Twitter account of the Feminist Resistance Movement (a grassroots anti-war organisation originated in Russia) published tragic news about the death of a transgender girl from Russia who committed suicide in a refugee camp in the city of Drachten in the Netherlands.
> 
> A transgender girl from Russia committed suicide in a refugee camp in the Netherlands.  Khina Zakharova applied for asylum in the Netherlands in December 2022. Earlier, the girl complained that there were serious problems with the queue for hormone replacement therapy in the country.
> 
> Khina Zakharova applied for asylum in the country in December 2022. At the time of the application, she needed hormone replacement therapy, the queue for which in the Netherlands, as Khina was informed, was long, with the approximate waiting period of over two years. The burden of accumulated problems turned out to be unbearable for Khina, resulting in tragedy.


This account by someone who knew Khina is telling:

> When there is not enough protection, where are you?
> 
> Monday evening February 27, 9.30 pm I received a report from a resident of one of the lhbtiq+ units in azc Drachten. Just before that, Khina had been found in the bathroom of her unit in her azc where she had committed suicide. For LGBT Asylum Support, this is a second trans asylum seeker who died by suicide in an azc within a month and a half.
> 
> Khina applied for asylum in the Netherlands as a trans woman in December 2022. During her flight to the Netherlands, a month before, she contacted her after KLM refused to let her board in Belgrade despite all the necessary papers. Nevertheless, a month later she managed to apply for asylum in the Netherlands and thus for protection. She announced herself with a cheerful message, characteristic of how she was: 'Hello, I'm in open camp Drachter, NL. Registration interview complete. I was in closed camp Schiphol. Meeting with my lawyer be in this Friday. It's Khina Zakharova.'
> 
> I then saw her in her azc, just as cheerful: 'Today is my second day in open camp. Meeting new people) People here is very good. It was an interesting experience.' But there were many problems under the skin. Not only the waiting times of the IND, which went from 6 to 15 months, but also that she begged in vain for help from agencies such as obtaining hormones and did not receive it. 'I've been at camp for a month now, but the GZA still hasn't given me a prescription for hormones. 
> 
> This worries me very much, since I only take hormones that I brought from Russia, but their quality is unknown to me.' But also mental help: 'I spoke with a psychotherapist from GZA. He said that he needed time to contact the hospital in Groningen. They have a team that deals with transgender people.
> 
> That mental help did not come, despite all her pleas to the GZA, but also to the national suicide prevention hotline 0800 113 to which we always refer. 'This whole situation with the expectation of a solution to my question puts a lot of pressure on me psychologically.' Because providing protection also means access to medical care.
> 
> Early this morning I got white roses and made her a message with a mourning photo for the more than 700 lhbtiq + asylum seekers that we assist as best as possible. A group, like Khina, who not only wait endlessly but are also in need, unable to process their traumas in overcrowded AZCs. A mourning photo with a much too young woman, 21 years old, who looks at you with a guitar. Who sent me hearts on my messages to finally belong to a family that understands and accepts her unconditionally. Numb with grief, today we called her best friend in her azc in Russian with her divorced parents in Russia, discussed Dela's checklist together with the COA. I spoke to Russian-speaking friends in her asylum seekers centre, her new friends, her new, proud LGBTIQ+ family. Then, with all the LGBTIQ+ residents at her unit, to commemorate her for a minute, or maybe it was longer. Wherever she is now.
> 
> Rest in peace Kina.
