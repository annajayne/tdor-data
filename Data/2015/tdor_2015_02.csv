Taja Gabrielle DeJesus,36,,2015_02_01_Taja-Gabrielle-DeJesus.jpg,,1-Feb-2015,tgeu/1-Feb-2015/Taja Gabrielle DeJesus,San Francisco,California,USA,37.78008,-122.420168,violence,stabbed,"Taja was discovered stabbed to death on a stairwell in San Francisco’s Bayview District on Sunday 1st February.

James Hayes, 40, was found hanging by the neck from a fence and apparently ""killed himself after the stabbing.""

> Taja was a Latina trans woman who lived in San Francisco, originally from San Jose. She worked with a trans organization called TRANS: THRIVE which serves the local transgender community. She was 36 years old. She has many people expressing shock, outrage and horror about her death – she was loved by many.  She volunteered at a community food pantry. She liked Prince and Madonna. She loved living in San Francisco.

Her mother Pamela DeJesus gave this testimonial about Taja:

> “I was a young mother, and I was raised in a very traditional family,” Pamela DeJesus said. “But I told my husband that we had to accept her no matter what. We knew she was going to deal with discrimination in the streets, but not at home. At home we needed acceptance.”
> 
> She said her daughter was active in her Bayview church and a volunteer at a food pantry. “Taja was beautiful inside and out,” she said through tears. “She was a rock for our family.”
> 
> Taja was different from an early age, her mother said. She remembered when Taja was 3 and asked, “When do I get to grow up and be a girl?”
> 
> As a teenager, Taja DeJesus was independent, her mother said, filing all the paperwork to get a job at 15 and often taking the train to San Francisco — “without permission,” her older sister, Erika, chimed in — because she knew the streets and dance clubs of San Francisco were more tolerant.
> 
> She loved music and used the money she earned to buy her first stereo, which typically played either Prince or Madonna. Eventually, she moved to the city, getting her own apartment in the Bayview, which she loved, according to her mom, even though it wasn’t the safest part of town.
> 
> “Whenever she had anything extra, she would give it away. That’s just how she was,” Pamela DeJesus said. “I don’t know how anybody could do this. But I’m proud of how strong and selfless she was. That’s what brings me peace.”

> She said of the killing, “I don’t know how anybody could do this. But I’m proud of how strong and selfless she was. That’s what brings me peace.”

Melonie Elizabeth Rose,19,,2015_02_11_Melonie-Elizabeth-Rose.jpg,http://www.dominickevans.com/2015/02/her-name-was-melonie-another-trans-woc-has-committed-suicide/,11-Feb-2015,,Laurel,Maryland,USA,39.099535,-76.848374,suicide,suicide,"Melonie died by suicide. In death, her parents erased her identity by burying her ""as a man"".

> Another transgender woman of color has taken her own life. Melonie Rose was a beautiful 19-year-old trans woman from Laurel, Maryland. From the start, Melonie had a hard life, having been shuffled from foster home to foster home. She dealt with emotional problems, as a result. No doubt, the discrimination Melonie endured did not help the young woman, who attended a therapeutic, alternative high school, Pathways, where she graduated in 2014.
> 
> I learned about Melonie from her close friend, Hunter. Like me, Hunter is a transman. He attended Pathways, with Melonie, and they graduated together, last year. Hunter describes Melonie as, “bright, and full of life and energy.” Melonie was Hunter’s female counterpart. His love for his dear friend is clear, as he writes about speaking at her memorial, telling the story of the last movie they saw together.
> 
> Hunter was quite upset, when he attended the memorial service for Melonie. He was shocked to see that her family had an open casket, and instead of dressing her the way Melonie would have wanted to dress, they put her in a suit. Additionally, family members spoke about her by using her birth name and using male pronouns, even though Melonie had legally changed her name. All of the paper materials handed out at the memorial, listed her as her former name, although a picture of Melonie, presenting as a male notes her chosen name of Melonie Rose in parenthesis, next to her birth name.
> 
> Melonie is not the first transgender person to commit suicide recently. She joins a growing number of young transgender people who have killed themselves, since 2015 began. She also isn’t the first to be denied her basic human rights of being buried, presented in death, and listed in her obituary and funeral materials by her chosen name and gender pronouns. Twitter is filled with hashtags, including #HerNamewasLeelah (for trans teen, Leelah Alcorn), #HisNameWasZander (for trans teen, Zander Mahaffey), #HerNameWasEylul (for Turkish transwoman, Eylül Cansin), and #HisNameIsDamien (for trans teen, Damien Strum, who was stopped before he could go through with killing himself, and is now in a psychiatric ward). With that in mind, I ask you all to celebrate the life of Melonie Rose by sharing her story, and refusing to let her be forgotten through the hashtag #HerNameWasMelonie.
> 
> We need to do better for our transgender youth. Melonie deserved to be accepted. She deserved to be remembered the way she felt comfortable, not how her family thought they should remember her. It is very important for transgender people, and their loved ones, to protect themselves from intolerant family members going against their own wishes. For transgender people who are over 18, it is imperative to have a will and power of attorney, clearly listing who can make medical decisions and end-of-life/death decisions. This is one of the only ways to prevent family members from exerting their own will into such sensitive matters. For transgender youth under the age of 18, this can be hard, because family is considered the default authority.
> 
> What needs to happen is, parents and other family members need to start accepting their children, no matter their gender identity. As parents, it is our job to love our children, no matter what. Sadly, the parents of Melonie Rose, and the other transgender youth mentioned above, have forgotten what being a parent means.
> 
> I will never forget you, Melonie. Rest in power, and know you are loved.

Melonie's death was not recorded on the officical TDoR 2015 list released by Transgender Europe (TGEU).

> 
> Proud, a 21-year-old black trans woman, was fatally shot multiple times by an unidentified assailant February 10th at 1:30 a.m. on the 1100 Block of North Claiborne Ave., in the Treme district of New Orleans. Her death sent shockwaves through her local trans community and through others nationwide, as her case became the fifth reported murder of a transgender woman of color within the first five weeks of 2015. 
> 
> A vigil for Proud on Tuesday was promoted on Twitter, where many mourned the accelerating succession of homicides with the hashtag #BlackTransLivesMatter.
> 
> It’s been very painful,” said a family member of the victim who declined to give her name, calling her a “wonderful human being.”

Kevin Golec, 52, was arrested on murder and felony domestic violence charges.

> Kevin Golec, 52, has been charged with murder and felony domestic violence. Police detained him shortly after 10 p.m. Friday after responding to several calls to 9-1-1 he made alleging that several members of a ""cult"" had broken into his house to commit robbery and had atacked both him and Bri Golec. With no evidence of a robbery, however, police determined that Golec was lying and that it was he who had had an altercation with and fatally stabbed his child.
> 
> Several advocates believe that Kevin Golec's statement about a non-existent cult may be a reference to a trans support group Bri Golec had allegedly begun attending again, notes the Correspondents.
> 
> Reports have conflicted on whether Bri Golec identified as trans, but the Correspondents, the first site to report Golec's death as the murder of a trans woman, noted that Golec had ""recently ... began to more assertively explore her gender identity."" Local trans activist Jacob Nash confirmed to the news site that Golec was involved in the local trans community and local group Trans Ohio has sent out a message stating that Golec was a trans woman.
> 
> Alternately, others who claim to have known the victim have stated on social media that Golec did not identify as trans, notes Gay Star News. Local media, including Cleveland.com, has meanwhile identified Golec as male, as has Golec's public obituary, which advocates have decried as misgendering.
> 
> The killing sent shockwaves through the local LGBT community. Brian Golec, a drummer in a punk rock band, once identified as a woman and went by the name Bri before changing back to a male identity in the last year, according to the Plain Dealer.
> 
> ""There was a time he identified as 'Bri' and as a woman, but for the last year or so, he identified as Brian,"" the victim's friend, Geoff Ackerman, told the Plain Dealer. ""But Brian hated labels.""

The Human Rights Campaign issued the following statement:

> ""Regardless of whether Golec was transgender, genderqueer, or otherwise gender nonconforming, (Golec joins) a staggeringly long list of LGBTQ individuals who have been murdered in 2015, including transgender women Lamia Beard, Ty Underwood, Yazmin Vash Payne, Taja Gabrielle DeJesus and Penny Proud.""

She was pronounced dead at the scene.

An autopsy proved inconclusive and her death was never ruled a homicide. However, reportedly she had been seen being chased by a man hours before.

> Described as a “bold, brave and brilliant young woman who loved her friends fiercely,” members of both Toronto’s LGBT and Somali communities are mourning her loss.
> 
> Though police say her death has been ruled not a homicide, posts saying Dalmar — who was also known as Sumaya Ysl — was a victim of murder spread quickly on social media. They asked why there had been no statement from police, why there was no media coverage and how the death of yet another trans woman of colour could be met with such silence.
> 
> In cases of “sudden death,” police do not typically release details of either the victim or the circumstances surrounding their death. In this case, however, police released a statement after requests for information.
> 
> On Tuesday afternoon, Toronto Police posted a statement to Facebook saying Dalmar was found unresponsive after a call from the Danforth Road and Main Street area. They said autopsy results were inconclusive and toxicology tests are pending.

Sumaya was born in Somalia and had migrated to Canada with her family as a child. In 2012 she was the subject of a short documentary and photography exhibition by the award-winning Somali-Canadian artist Abdi Osman. It described her as undergoing speech therapy training and being “actively involved in the transgender community”.

Her friends described her as 'a bold, brave and brilliant young woman'. Despite this, reportedly she was estranged from her family, who opposed her transition and refused to release any information about her death.

> Details remain sparse and what appears to be deliberate radio silence on the part of the Toronto Police Service and her birth parents continues to feed speculation about what exactly happened to Sumaya. What we do know is that the senseless violence against the trans- community needs to end and that begins with wider media coverage and an understanding that people who are transgender deserve equal protection under the law.
> 
> But with the backdrop of shocking statistics on violence against the trans community in North America and amid all the online speculation, police issued a statement on Facebook saying officers “are conducting a thorough investigation”.
