Amber Monroe,20,,2015_08_08_Amber Monroe.jpg,https://planettransgender.com/amber-monroe-found-murdered-becomes-12th-trans-woman-killed-in-us-this-year/,8-Aug-2015,tgeu/8-Aug-2015/Amber Monroe,Detroit,Michigan,USA,42.332916,-83.047853,violence,shot,"Amber's body was found on the morning of Saturday 8th August. According to police, she was shot at around 5am as she got out of a vehicle near Palmer Park.

Her death was reported by Equality Michigan:

> ‘The body of 20-year old Amber Monroe was found murdered in Detroit this morning. Early reports claim that she was shot, but information is still developing and no details have been released by the Detroit Police Department.
> 
> Amber was a black transgender woman barely 20 years old who studied at Wayne State University, and loved her friends and Vogueing. According to Cherno Biko, a trans rights advocate who had been talking to friends of Monroe and other people on the ground in Detroit, Amber “was 20 years old and full of life and such a fighter. This was actually her third time being shot, but she wasn’t comfortable going to the police the first two times because of the relationship Black trans women in Detriot have with the police.”
> 
> “Our hearts are heavy with grief that we have lost another vibrant member of our community too soon. Our thoughts and prayers go out to all of Amber’s family and friends whom she clearly loved deeply,” said Yvonne Siferd, Director of Victim Services for Equality Michigan.
> 
> “We have no idea yet whether this attack was fuelled by transphobia, but we do know that Amber’s murder is the 12th murder of a transgender woman in the United States this year, and the 10th murder of a transgender woman of colour. Transgender women, and especially transgender women of colour, are disproportionately affected by violence.
> 
> Her life was just beginning; I know that this loss will leave so many people with a hole in their lives and with more questions than answers. Let’s come together to celebrate her life, and work for real change so that our transgender sisters can be free from persecution. I know we can do better. We have to do better.’

Kandis Capri,35,,2015_08_11_Kandis-Capri.jpg,http://www.jasonhowardgreen.com/2015/08/vigil-for-kandis-capri-wednesday-august.html,11-Aug-2015,tgeu/11-Aug-2015/Kandis Capri,Phoenix,Arizona,USA,33.448204,-112.072585,violence,shot,"Kandis was shot outside a friend's apartment complex at around 11:30pm on Tuesday 11th August. She died in hospital.

Her phone and purse were missing, and witnesses reported seeing a man leaving the area on foot.

> Kandis Capri, also known as [deadname], was shot multiple times on Aug. 11 and her body was found in a parking lot at La Reserve Apartments at 2627 N. 45th Ave. A suspect was seen leaving the area on foot, police said.
> 
> Capri was taken to the hospital, where she was pronounced dead.
>
> According to the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs (NCAVP), Kandis Capri, 35, was one of 16 transgender people to be murdered in the US this year.
> 
> “The only thing I know [for sure] is that my [daughter] was murdered,” Andria Gaines, Capri’s mother, told the Guardian. “[Kandis] was shot and I don’t know all the circumstances.”
> 
> Gaines continued: “[Capri] was at a lady’s apartment who [she] had been staying with for a couple of weeks. And the only thing I know is that the car [she] had rented had been towed or something, or suspected of being towed away, so [she] left her apartment and was shot.”

A vigil was held for her on 19th August.

> I took a moment to read some of the comments on the FB post announcing this vigil and I came across this, ""How does this happen in Phoenix?""  I guess it's nice to know some people still see Phoenix as a place where violence against the LGBT community doesn't happen.  This person must be new to the city or totally unaware of what's been happening here.  Please check out some of the links below as a reminder of just how ""welcoming"" our city is for LGBT folks. [Let it be noted: I do not think our city is exceptionally violent toward our community.  I just think that homophobia and violence towards the LGBT community exists here as it does everywhere else].

Kandis was just getting her life back together after transition. She had started attending church and enrolled in theology classes at South Mountain Community College.

In time she may have become a faith leader in the LGBT+ community, but instead she became yet another of our community whose loss we mourn.

What an absolutely terrible waste of a young life.

The same vehicle then reversed back over her and ran her over again.

Luis M. Sanchez, 27, was subsequently arrested in Colorado and charged with first-degree murder and armed criminal action.

> Though police can't confirm Dominguez' murder was a hate crime, members of the Kansas City transgender community told us they are often fearful and the hate is real.
> 
> ""There's this horrible dark underbelly of hatred that goes on and on and on and on and it must stop,"" said Caroline Gibbs with the Transgender Institute of Kansas City.

> Dominguez's family says police found her car near Independence Avenue. They still say they don't know why she was in that area or whom she may have been with in the truck.
> 
> Witnesses say they saw a black Chevy Avalanche at the scene.
> 
> Police say the driver initially hit Dominguez, then ran over her body at least two more times.
> 
> ""We understand that maybe they were arguing, but it's not fair for what he did. It ain't fair,"" Rendon said.

Through a translator, Tamara's brother, Alberto, delivered this message to the driver:

> ""He just want to say to the person that did that to her, that he (Alberto) would forgive them for what he did to her,"" Dominguez said through translation as he started to cry. ""We are not here to judge nobody, and he (Alberto) hopes that person really feels bad for what he did.""
> 
> Family members are certain of one thing - she was loved.
> 
> ""He doesn't know she has family. She had her mom. She had her nephews, brothers, and sisters. That person didn't think about what he did,"" Rendon said.
