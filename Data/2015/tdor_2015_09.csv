Marcela Estefanya Chocobar,26,,2015_09_06_Marcela-Chocobar.jpg,https://www.tiemposur.com.ar/nota/156535-noche-de-siluetas,6-Sep-2015,tgeu/6-Sep-2015/Marcela Estefanya Chocobar,Río Gallegos,Santa Cruz,Argentina,-50.019205,-68.523053,violence,murdered,"Marcela was last seen alive when she left a bar in the downtown area of  Río Gallegos and climbed into a red Renault 9. Several days later her skull, along with some clothes and a wig, were found in a field in the San Benito neighborhood.

The rest of her body has never been found.

> In the freezing morning of September 6, 2015, while Saturday night was quiet in the bars and bowling alleys of the city of Rio Gallegos, Marcela Estefanía Chocobar , a 26-year-old trans-girl from Salta, had decided to stand alone at the door from the bar ""Russia"", where she had been dancing until a while ago with friends, in the most classic ritual of street prostitution: waiting for customers. That was the last time they saw her alive.
> 
> A security camera recorded her and witnesses at the bowling door saw her climbing into a red Renault 9 with two subjects.
> 
> After she went missing her sisters Karina, Judtih, Gabriela and Laura began a desperate and lonely search that lasted for days (and for them it seemeds eternal) with the ever weakening hope that she was alive. ""In the courthouse they gave us three hypotheses: that a trafficking network had taken her, that she was involved in a drug issue or that she had left with someone, a boyfriend,"" recalls Laura.
> 
> A few days later, a neighbor from the San Benito neighborhood - on the outskirts of the capital of Santa Cruz - found a skull without soft tissue, without any trace of skin, and, seven blocks from that place, a chain, a dress and a black jacket, a white buccaneer and a blonde wig that confirmed the worst: Marcela was murdered and dismembered. The rest of her body has never been found.

In April 2019 Ángel Azzolini and Oscar Biott went to trial on charges of homicide, and the following month the prosecution requested that the charge be raised to transfemicide.  In June Biott was sentenced to life in prison and Azzolini to 6 years.

> On September 6, 2015, Marcela Chocobar was brutally murdered. From her, a trans woman in the splendor of her transformation, they found only her perfectly cut skull between the second and third vertebrae. In April a judge put three men accused of the homicide in prison, but she refused to treat the crime as femicide. But the Chocobar family does not believe that the horror can be explained that easily: they are convinced that the guys who raised Marcela that night were only instruments of something worse, of an evil whose existence would be explained only if it comes from power.

In October 2020 the Supreme Court ordered that the convictions be reviewed.

> In the last few hours a new chapter was added to the case of Marcela Chocobar, the young trans woman who was murdered in the early morning of September 6, 2015 and whose body has still not been found, when the Superior Court of Justice (TSJ) ordered a review of the convictions for the transfemicide.

> ""Like a lot of you, I've been feeling pretty gutted about the recent election.  I've been shocked and horrified to realise the extent to which things can and probably will get worse now that it's no longer a coalition but the Conservatives on their own.  I've been first uncomprehending, then angry and misanthropic, in the face of  a group of humans getting together and deciding that it would be a good idea to get rid of the human rights act.  Misanthropic like:  OK, you all voted for this shit, fucking have it then, I hope it makes you weep.
>
> But we didn't all vote for this.  We don't all deserve this.  
>
> There is hope.  Not (in my opinion) hope of making this government behave more kindly to the poorest and most vulnerable people, but hope that people will do more to help each other because they can see the need to, thus mitigating the unkindness pouring down on us from those in power.""

SHe had been shot in the chest, had numerous stab wounds in the back and dorsal area and a bruise covering her right eye.

> Fernanda ""Coty"" Olmos was a beloved neighbor of the Alfonso neighborhood of Santa Fe. She had spearheaded complaints from the residents of the neighborhood and in particular, she stood out for her supportive work during the dramatic floods that affected the city in 2003.
>
> On Friday afternoon, Fernanda was murdered in her humble home. A friend called 911 when she found the door ajar and a policeman found her dead body by the side of the bed.
>
> She had suffered blows to his face, several stabs on his neck, deep stab wounds on his back and abdomen, and a .22 caliber bullet in his chest. In addition, according to the experts had defense marks and the place was in complete disorder: there were broken glass, which denotes that there was a fight.
> 
> The brutality of the murder suggests that it is a transphobic crime, a femicide against a trans woman. However, the experts made statements in the media using the innocuous category of ""personal conflict"". This is not surprising since the Regional Prosecutor Ricardo Fessi reported the facts to the media by calling the victim [deadname]. A transphobic, retrograde and disrespectful attitude, about which the formality of the DNI [legal name] can not even be exposed as an excuse, since it it clearly says ""Fernanda Olmos"".
