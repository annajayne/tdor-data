> Early police and media accounts consistently misnamed and misgendered the victim, and only now are we learning that, according to BuzzFeed LGBTQ, her name was Papi Edwards and that she identified as a transgender woman.

> “Another one of our sisters has been misgendered in the media,” Lourdes Ashley Hunter of the Trans Women of Color Collective told AlterNet. “Her life has been sensationalized with allegations of prostitution. They are already coloring this murder. They’re framing that our lives don’t matter when they do that. It’s no surprise that this is happening with this narrative because this is how they discredit trans people.”

Lamia loved to travel, loved different cultures and spoke French fluently. She was also apparently an excellent singer, loved music and dancing, and excellent at make-up with perfection. Her favorite singer was Beyonce.

Her body was found after police broke down the door to her apartment in Haymerlegasse 22 in Vienna's Ottakring district.

> The naked and bound body of a Turkish citizen found on Sunday afternoon after police broke down the door to her apartment has been reported as being a 35-year-old transsexual asylum seeker.
According to a press release from the asylum rights organization Asylum in Need, the transgender woman was not allowed to work, and therefore had turned in desperation to prostitution to support herself. 
> 
> The organization criticized the current asylum system, saying that through a ""lack of alternatives she was forced to look into the sex trade"". 
> 
> They further called for basic social support for asylum seekers, ""from which one can live and is not forced into the underground economy or sex work"".
> 
> According to an autopsy report from Monday, the victim was most likely strangled. Her hands had been tied behind her back, and she was found naked with a cloth ligature around her neck.

A month later a 32-year-old Serbian was arrested in connection with her murder after DNA analysis matched his profile.

He had recently robbed a sex worker at a Thai massage studio in Ottakring, and a day later he robbed an alternative healer in Vienna.  The latter was able to give an accurate description of the suspect, allowing police to make a quick arrest. The suspect was already in custody for the armed robbery of the 54-year-old healer, when Hande's body was found.

After being presented with the DNA evidence, the suspect made a full confession. He claimed to be short of money and had murdered Hande during a robbery.

Carlton Ray Champion Jr., 21, was convicted of first degree murder.

> 
> ""He kind of laughed and chuckled the whole time,"" said Ty Underwood's friend Kenyaah Darks. ""You see his lawyer kind of like tapping him telling him to be quiet, straighten up, sit up and things like that, and he took it as a joke.""
> 
> But it's no joke when the verdict comes in: Guilty of first-degree murder. He could have received as little as five years, but after another outburst of arrogance in court, Champion gets life.
> 
> But even that life sentence doesn't stop him from taunting still members of Ty's family as he leaves the courtroom.
> 
> ""Carlton Champion Jr. killed Ty Underwood because he was afraid the secret was gonna come out, that if this relationship went south, everyone was gonna find out that he's in a relationship with a transgender woman, and he could not take that thought,"" said Cory McCoy.
> 
> Unbelievably, Carlton Champion still thinks he can get out of this. He sent a letter to Crime Watch Daily, writing ""the police did dirty work"" and that he's ""looking good, feeling good... Waiting to get free so I can see what the world got to offer me.""
> 
> Champion's lawyer indicated his client will appeal. Carlton Champion will be eligible for parole in 2045.

Ty was employed as a nursing assistant at a retirement home and was planning to enter a nursing program at Kilgore College in Longview, Texas.

> ""Ty was a person who wasn't scared of anything,"" said Ty's friend Kenyaah Darks. ""Ty wasn't fearful, so when it came down to the world accepting who she was, it was 'live it to the fullest every day, because you just never know.'""
