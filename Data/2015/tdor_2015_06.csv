>
> The day after Vermont's death, Jesus and Mendes were arrested by civil police for loose procedural fraud and perjury.

> The family of the 18-year-old [trans woman] Laura Vermont, who was killed a week ago in the East Zone of Sao Paulo, questioned the military police's statement that she had got into a police car and driven it into a wall. According to the victim's mother and sister, Zilda and Rejane Laurentino, she could not drive and therefore could not have driven the vehicle.
>
> Her body was found stabbed and she had been shot in the arm. Report from the Legal Medical Institute (IML) concluded that the cause of death was the head injury she suffered and not the shot.
>
> ""She was two blocks from home, walking in the opposite direction from where the car was. It makes no sense that she drove the car,"" said her sister.
