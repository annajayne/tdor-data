> São Paulo - The Municipal Secretariat of Human Rights and Citizenship of São Paulo released earlier this afternoon (15) a note declaring itself in mourning for the death of one of the participants of the Transcidadania Program , a social reintegration project launched three months ago by the City Hall . The 43-year-old [trans woman] La Monique de Roma was shot and killed yesterday morning in the Jockey Club region of Butantã, west of the city. According to the city, it was a case of murder.
> 
> “La Monique is another victim of a context of high vulnerability. Like her, many [trans women] live by sex work, one of the few alternatives they find for their subsistence, as the prejudice for their gender identities impacts their daily lives in the most diverse dimensions, and especially in the opportunities for offered to them ”, says the secretary. “ We emphasize La Monique's dedication and commitment to the activities of the Transcidadania Program, at which time she resumed her studies after 15 years away from the classroom. The struggle for the recovery of her dignity as a [trans woman] citizen will always be a constituent part of her career. ”
>
> Developed through a partnership between the Departments of Human Rights and Development, Labor and Entrepreneurship, Transcidadania is entitled to a scholarship for those who fulfill a 30-hour weekday that includes school and vocational training. In the first stage, the goal is to serve 100 [trans women] in socially vulnerable situations.
>
> Deputy Secretary of Human Rights and Citizenship, Rogério Sottili, in a text published on the social network Facebook, also regretted the episode. “ From living with some beneficiaries, when I met La Monique de Roma, she told me that she had greatly reduced sex work activity with the financial aid that the program gives, which allowed her to devote more time to study and training. I deeply regret her death, but know that the appreciation of the LGBT citizenship we are promoting in the city will not let her death be in vain. We work tirelessly until we no longer have [trans] victims of a context of high vulnerability and social prejudice for their gender identity. ”

Last Monday, 25th, the day she was murdered, she was due to start a technical nursing course and was interning at the Emergency Hospital of Sergipe (HUSE). “I had a conversation with her a few days earlier and she told me that she would quit prostitution because of the lack of respect shown to sex workers. She said, 'Thatiane, they throw stone and urine at us here. No one respects us, '”Astra's president recalled.

While her murder has sparked protests and international outrage no arrests have been made.

> The brutal murder drew condemnation from David Morales the Attorney for the Defense of Human Rights of El Salvador, who said it was an expression of “rejection” and “hatred” against the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people ( LGTBI).
> 
> Morales called on the prosecutor to conduct an “investigation of the murder of Francela Mendez, without use of discriminatory criteria, as this would violate due process”.
> 
> The ombudsman noted that the El Salvadorian justice system is indifferent to the murder of trans women which in turn stimulates more heinous attacks.

Francela was a human rights activist who worked daily with Colectivo Alejandría, an organization that advocates for the rights of gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people in El Salvador.
> 
> Like many LGBT activists, Francela Méndez Rodríguez served in dual roles. She worked to combat stigma and discrimination through Colectivo Alejandría, an advocacy organization she helped create in 2010. She also implemented HIV programs in her community as part of the Global Fund's project in El Salvador.
> 
> In May, Francela's efforts on behalf of her community were cut short by violence. She was murdered by unknown assailants while visiting the home of a friend, who was also killed during the attack. According to Front Line Defenders, she was the tenth trans woman to be murdered in the country in 2015. She was 29 years old.
> 
> Francela's case is far from isolated. For many people who provide HIV services to LGBT populations, managing violence has become a part of the job. Attacks against clients, volunteers, staff members and leadership have been recorded around the world, and their impact on HIV services has been devastating.
