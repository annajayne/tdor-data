> A Black transgender woman was found dead in a Georgia park on Saturday, a scenario that has played out far too many times for the trans community this year.
> 
> Felycya Harris, a 33-year-old interior decorator who also taught dance, was discovered in Meadowbrook Park in Augusta, Georgia. The modestly sized recreational area is adjacent to an elementary school of the same name, located on the southwestern outskirts of the state capital.
> 
> According to the Augusta Chronicle newspaper, Harris died as a result of gunshot wounds. Her death was ruled as a homicide by Richmond County Coroner Mark Bowen, although a motive is unknown and a suspect has yet to be identified.
> 
> Local community members claimed they are in the dark regarding the circumstances which led up to her tragic death.
> 
> “We don’t know what happened — only God knows,” friend and supporter Angela Bales told the Chronicle, one of dozens rallying in her name under “Justice for Felycya” posts on Twitter and Facebook. “We’ve got to have some sort of justice for her.”

The Human Rights Campaign paid tribute to her, calling her a young woman whose life was “full of promise.”

> “Felycya... ran her own company where she enjoyed lending her eye to improve the surroundings of others, and made others feel comfortable in their own space,” the organization said. “She said she could do ‘just about anything with decorating,’ which she learned from her late grandmother.”

He even cut off one of her fingers in order to send decoy messages from her phone in an attempt to throw off the investigation.

> A Russian policeman has confessed to murdering his transgender ex-girlfriend. According to reports, the officer committed murder out of jealousy, before cutting off her finger to send decoy messages from the dead woman's phone.
> 
> On October 13, the body of 24-year-old Viktoria Basakovskaya was found in the village of Burmistrovo, close to Novosibirsk, the largest city in Siberia and 3,000km east of Moscow. Eight days previously, a 20-year-old policeman, named only as Denis K., announced her disappearance and even helped put up flyers.
> 
> After some time, police suspicion began to focus on one of their fellow officers, Basakovskaya's ex-boyfriend. After interrogation, he confessed and revealed where he had hidden her body. According to the local investigative committee, she was found with strangulation marks on her neck.
> 
> The likely motive for the murder is jealousy, according to an investigation by local Novosibirsk newspaper ngs.ru. After speaking to a close friend of Basakovskaya, it was revealed that she met Denis K. last year. He worked as a patrol officer for the railway police. Prior to dating Denis K., Basakovskaya had a long and complicated relationship with another man, named Maxim, and Denis K. remained jealous of that relationship throughout.
> 
> ""He is a mentally ill person. I do not know how he was accepted into the police,"" said Alina (not her real name), a friend of Basakovskaya. ""The relationship between Vika and Denis was not very good… According to Vika, he sometimes beat her to such a state that she lost consciousness.""

He was a police officer, and his assailant allegedly knew that he was a trans man.

> Mickerlange François, a transgender policeman was shot dead in Pétion-Ville, in a nightclub on the evening of Saturday, October 17. Two days later police apprehended Obenson Saindor, 28, aboard a motorcycle while trying to get to Dame-Marie, Grand’Anse on the coast.
> 
> Due to the public and media apathy, and the prevalence of transphobia in society and Haitian law enforcement, we are just now learning about the murder of Officer François.
> 
> After the policeman’s death, investigators focused on the community and barraged LGBT+ Haitians with excessive questions about the victim, according to Midou Blonski (pseudonym), a leader of the Haitian advocacy group FACSDIS (Femme en Action contre la Stigmatisation et la Discrimination Sexuelle/Women Taking Action Against Sexual Stigmatization and Discrimination).

According to the advocacy journalist Moïse Manoel, the motive may have been jealousy:

> The alleged murderer, 28-year-old Obenson Saindor, shot policeman Mickerlange François in a Pétionville nightclub on Oct. 17.
> 
> Passion and jealousy were motives, as the victim had engaged in a romantic relationship with the alleged murderer’s partner. The alleged murderer had already threatened Mickerlange’s life while telling him to stay away from his household. Unfortunately, the victim did not take these threats seriously.
> 
> The alleged murderer was apprehended with the victim’s police service weapon, a 9mm caliber revolver.  Obenson was also in possession of a second revolver, which investigators said could have been used to commit the crime.
> 
> The alleged murderer knew the policeman was a trans man. The fact that Mickerlange died because of his gender identity disgusts me.
> 
> In addition, for me, this affair illustrates the way women are treated in Haiti. They are not respected and are seen as objects. Consequently, one can kill a rival, even a trans man, as one pleases. Women are seen as property, for one’s exclusive benefit.
> 
> This homicide illustrates anew the negation of feminine desire and aspirations. Because she loved someone else, he must be killed—without reflecting on what isn’t working between the original couple. That’s the problem.
> 
> We remain in a patriarchal society where women’s desires are ignored. This mentality leads only to submission or death.

The restaurant which opened in September was run completely by transpersons. She had opened it primarily to provide jobs to members of her community who had become unemployed due to the pandemic. Sangeetha had fought many battles to ensure that her business was up and running.  Though she started a catering business in 2014, she has many times spoken about how people would not rent places. During the lockdown, since most restaurants were shut, she started the 32-seater kitchen so that it would be beneficial for people from the community and others.

He confessed to having stolen ₹20,000 ($270USD) from Sangeetha’s residence and ran away to his hometown, the police said. According to the Hindu, Rajesh murdered Sangeetha Sunday night when she threatened to report him to police on charges of sexual assault.

> The transsexual woman murdered by gunshots, this Sunday night (25), in the rural area of ​​the municipality of Rio Largo, is the 15th case of violent death against the LGBTQI + community this year, according to the Gay Group of Alagoas (GGAL). From January to October 2020, there are already five trans women victims of violence in Alagoas.
> 
> Joana Domingos was the social name of [deadname] Domingos da Silva, 19 years old. She was hit by seven gunshots while by the side of the highway, at the entrance to the Antônio Lins complex in the Mata do Rolo neighborhood.
> 
> The case will be investigated by the Rio Largo homicide officer, Lucimério Campos. Initial investigations were performed by a team at the scene, and the investigation should be launched this week. The police will hear witnesses to try to identify the motive and locate possible suspects.
> 
> The president of GGAL, Nildo Correia, regrets yet another violent death involving the LGBTQI + public, blaming the State for the lack of attention. ""Unfortunately, this rampant violence mainly affects minorities. With 15 people killed this year, the statistics reveal an average of more than one murder per month. This is only due to the absence of public policies, which would work to insert into the labor market, in school and culture"".
> 
> According to him, most of the crimes do not lead to a suspect being identified, compromising the investigation. ""In many cases, there is not even a suspect, let alone a defendant I confess. This is the reality, perhaps, due to the absence of public equipment and the lack of interest among some professionals"", he highlights.

Subsequently the province's police watchdog misgendered her in a news release.

> Members of Toronto's LGBTQ community are demanding answers after a 30-year-old Black transgender woman died last week after being taken into custody under Ontario's Mental Health Act, and was misgendered by the province's police watchdog in a news release.
> 
> On Oct. 26, Ontario's Special Investigations Unit (SIU) launched an investigation into what it said was the death of a 30-year-old man in Toronto.
> 
> According to the agency, which looks into any death, serious injury or allegation of sexual assault where police were present, preliminary information suggested Toronto police arrived at an apartment on Bellamy Road in Scarborough after a 911 call was made around 7 a.m. 
> 
> ""When officers arrived at an 8th floor apartment unit, they observed that a man had barricaded himself inside the unit,"" the SIU said in a news release. ""However, the officers were able to eventually make their way inside.""
> 
> The release goes on to say the ""man,"" whose name was not released, was apprehended under Mental Health Act and taken to hospital, before ""he"" went into medical distress and was pronounced dead at 10:15 a.m.
> 
> In a statement Tuesday, The 519, an LGBTQ advocacy organization, said it had confirmed the individual was in fact a ""much loved"" Black trans woman. The organization is now demanding more details about what happened.
> 
> ""Among the many questions for public officials, why has the SIU published a news release that misgenders the woman who died after being informed of this error? We refuse to wait any longer for information and answers from the [Toronto Police Service] and the SIU that account for this loss of life,"" the statement says.
> 
> ""Those closest to this tragic loss, family and friends, are owed answers. Those in our communities are owed answers. More information is needed — and it is needed now.""
> 
> The organization added it will not be publishing the woman's name at this time out of respect for family and friends who may not know the details of her death. 
>
> ""To all of you who are grieving, we extend deep and heartfelt condolences. We share your grief,"" the statement says.
