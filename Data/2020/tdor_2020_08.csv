> Josselin, a 29-year-old trans woman of Salvadoran origin who had requested asylum in this country and lived in zone 7 of Guatemala City, was murdered at her home. Her mother found her, with multiple blows and a disfigured face on the morning of Saturday, August 1. 
> 
> Josselin engaged in the informal clothing and makeup trade in the market in the same area. She had been living between Guatemala and El Salvador for 12 years, where she was constantly traveling with her mother when in 2018, due to persecution by gangs and violence in El Salvador due to the lack of recognition of her gender identity, she requested refuge in Guatemala. This was reported to Presentes Carlos Valdez, a member of Lambda Guatemala (Organization for Equality, Dignity and Human Rights of Gays, Lesbians, Bisexual Men and Women, Trans and Intersex Men and Women of Guatemala). Until the date of her death there was no resolution from the Guatemalan Migration Institute, she says. Lambda had been supporting Josselin because of the Covid-19 pandemic crisis with housing and food.

The United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) condemned her murder.

> The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) expressed its dismay at the violent death of a Salvadoran transsexual woman, who, for having suffered violence due to her gender identity and gang persecution in El Salvador, had requested an asylum process in Guatemala.
> 
> In a statement, UNHCR explained that the woman's body was found on August 1 at her home in Guatemala City and that she had escaped from El Salvador, after she was the victim of violence.
> 
> In this regard, they call on the Guatemalan authorities ""to thoroughly investigate death in view of their commitment to protect people from the LGBTI community and people who request international protection in the country.""
> 
> Giovanni Bassu, UNHCR Regional Representative for Central America and Cuba, expressed his condolences to the family and loved ones of this woman ""who was trying to rebuild her life in Guatemala after having been forced to flee her country due to violence.""

> The revelation, made to the EPTV channel by one of Alice's friends, who explained that the victim was spending a few days at a friend's house in Ribeirão Preto, and was called to a motel [on Avenida Barão do Bananal] by her ex-boyfriend, who used an unidentified number [presumably, to trick her].
> 
> She contacted her current boyfriend and warned that the man who had called her to the motel was from the city of Florianópolis, the same municipality where her abusive ex was born. Then Alice's cell phone was turned off.
> 
> The victim's body was not found until six days after she left the motel in a white car accompanied by the man. The case is being investigated in secrecy by the Homicide Police in Ribeirão Preto.

There is no doubt that the way Rocío was treated made her death far more likely than it might otherwise have been.

> On August 2 at dawn, Olga, Rocío's mother, found her daughter in the bathroom and became worried. Olga is a nurse, she noticed that her daughter was cyanotic. ""We called 107 (Emergency Service) because Rocío was suffering an asthma attack,"" said Matías. ""They told us they were changing shifts, so we had to wait until they got organized."" While they waited, her mother tried to reassure her. When the ambulance arrived they refused to transfer her to the hospital: ""because the COVID 19 protocol is active and they said they did not have the clothing [presumably PPE] to transport her,"" Caballero explained.
> 
> The family decided to take her by their own means to the biggest hospital in the province, the Madariaga. “There they made us wait in the hall, while she was breaking down more and more, at one point she could hardly breathe. My wife insisted on starting a dialogue with a doctor, who, seeing the state in which Rocío was found, began to shout for quick attention. She had to be intubated because she was already on 64 oxygen saturation (the ambulance nurse took 64 and when she arrived at the hospital she had 60) ”.
> 
> According to the family, at the Madariaga the first swab was done with a negative result. Then they were told that they had to transfer her to the Fatima hospital due to lack of beds. ""But with the excuse that there they had to have the best therapists, who were prepared to receive any patient with respiratory problems,"" said the stepfather. 
> 
> The family asked to be transferred to the René Favaloro hospital, located in Villa Cabello, blocks from their home. After a first refusal, they accepted the transfer for Rocío's health ”which took place that same August 2 at around 8:00 p.m. There she had another swab that was also negative.
> 
> ""While hospitalized in Fatima she caught pneumonia"" denounces the family. And they say that ""from the first moment we had friction with Dr. Carlos Tozzeto, who told us at all times that Rocío was a man, that she had a man's anatomy, and that he was going to refer to her as a male."" Caballero reported that ""Rocío had her woman's document and had her birth certificate as a woman because at age 18 she changed her gender."" ""We explained all this to the doctor, and he told us that for him she was still a man,"" said the missionary. 
> 
> Rocío's mother said that in the last days of hospitalization she saw her daughter “very abandoned. They did not sanitize her, they did not move her, they did not change the fixation of the tube, the discharge was left with blood on her side, her face was all dirty full of secretions, it was clear that her eyes were not cleaned ”.
> 
> After spending several days in the hospital, ""the doctor informed the mother that she no longer had pneumonia and that little by little they were going to remove the sedation so that she would wake up,"" said Caballero. 
> 
> The next day, the family learned of Rocío's death through the condolences of an acquaintance. Upon receiving the news in this way, the stepfather went to the hospital at 6 in the morning. “When I ask him for the death certificate, Dr. Tozzeto refuses to give me the paper. He tells me that by hospital protocol he could only give me a photocopy, ”Caballero said indignantly. He explained that no one gave him explanations, and they even put two security agents at the entrance to prevent him from entering.
> 
> With the photocopy of the death certificate, the stepfather went to the Registry of Persons, where they asked him for the original certificate. The man says that he had to go four times by bus from the Registry in Posadas to the hospital in Garupá.
> 
> The family says Registry staff tried to contact the hospital and wrote a note to obtain the original documentation. It was delivered and ignored. Olga, Rocío's mother, also appeared at the hospital, since the family at one point suspected that they were not giving the certificate to Caballero because he was not the biological father of the young woman. 
> 
> The stepfather continued insisting regarding the constancy, and after the refusals of the health professionals, he asked to see the director. He got him to be attended by Dr. Jaime Brestzki, the hospital manager. Olga explained to the doctor that, as a nurse, she knows that they cannot deny their relatives a death certificate. Given this, the doctor acknowledged that they made a mistake and handed over the document.
> 
> By protocol, the family could not enter the morgue or recognize or remove the body. Caballero had to obtain a truck at the request of the hospital and resorted to calling a delegate from the Municipality of Itaembé Miní to get a drawer.
> 
>  “They gave me white gloves and with my personal mask (my own) I entered the place. They didn't want to help me load the body into the drawer. I had to carry it, put it in the drawer, they did not let me dress her, they did not clean her, I had to take her out with a hospital gown ""she said and reported that when she requested help due to the weight of the body"" the nurse said ""since so much You insist, you do it '”, using the excuse of the“ protocol for COVID ”. 
> 
> The hospital formally reported the death of the young woman at 6:00 p.m. on August 11. The record details that she died at 00.35. In other words, it was almost 18 hours before they notified the relatives.

>
> A partner from #Tucumán communicated with @cha_argentina, Bruno Bazán, an activist from Kompañeres Tucumán Peroncha. He informed us that she actually used the last name Solorzano because it was [the name of] the person coordinating the ""Dios los Cría"" bowling alley.
>
> Vanesa's last name is Rotolo and she was killed in the South Zone of Tucumán. The almost zero impact that #transesticides and #transfemicides often have on national media seems to indicate that murders due to #identity, still respond to binary gender visions.
>
> We ask the media for collaboration to jointly change the information criteria and fight to overcome the binary and patriarchal vision that does not consider these murders as transesticides, transfemicides or femicide, according to their self-employed identity. The press release from @cha_argentina was released today.

Officers administered first aid at the scene before transporting her to the hospital, where she subsequently passed away. Early media reports on her murder misgendered Sam and used her deadname.

He has reportedly confessed to killing her.

> On the orders of the prosecutor Alfonso Serretiello of the Prosecutor's Office of Vallo della Lucania (Sa), a man has been in custody since late afternoon today for the murder of the 66-year-old trans [woman] Francesca Galatro. The suspect, with a criminal record, allegedly acted out of jealousy.
> 
> The woman was found lifeless yesterday afternoon, with a knife stuck in her heart, in her room at a shelter for the homeless managed by the S8 Zone Plan of which the Municipality of Vallo is the leading body. The Municipality had ordered the closure due to Covid emergency and Francesca would have to leave the structure, like another ten guests (including a family), tomorrow.

Francesca was originally from Buonabitacolo, had a degree in engineering and experience as a teacher.
She suffered from depression and had asked to be admitted to the shelter the previous year. She was also a devout Christian who attended Mass regularly.

> The news [of her murder] shocked the community of Vallo where the woman was also known for her profound religiosity, which led her to participate in the celebration of Mass every evening.
> 
> As stated to Gaynews by the architect and trans activist Ottavia Voza, ""beyond the specific aspects linked to this heinous crime, the outline of which is taking shape as the investigations develop, what is once again striking is the marginalization experienced too often by trans women, who live the burden of loneliness and the difficulties of social integration.
> 
> ""Francesca was an engineer who had to resort to the assistance of public services to overcome her material difficulties, and it is not difficult to imagine that her condition as a trans woman who lived in small southern [towns] could have had a decisive weight in the development of her personal history"".

> Claudia Leite was 26 years old, transsexual, lived in the municipality of Canindé de São Francisco and, like many other transgender people in Brazil, had a dream: to be able to live in peace. However, at dawn last Thursday, the 20th, her name ended up in the ranking that anguishes and despairs several LGBTQIA + citizens in the country: that of violence against the public.
> 
> Relatives of the young woman told the police that she had recently ended a relationship and, after she disappeared, decided to file a police report. The agents started searching for the main suspect, her ex-partner, identified as Marques José dos Santos, 19 years old. After he was located he confessed to killing the young woman.
> 
> According to information from the Civil Police, “Gaspar”, as he is known, said that, after the end of their relationship, he arranged a meeting with her, in a location known as Beira Rio, saying that they needed to talk. When they arrived, unhappy with the end of the relationship, he ended up arguing with the young woman.
> 
> According to his testimony, during the argument the suspect punched the transsexual [woman] in the face. She lost her balance and fell from a height of approximately six meters As a result of the fall she died.
> 
> After that, he confessed that he dragged the victim and threw her into the São Francisco River, leaving her to be carried by the current. Her body [was found on 21st August near Buraco do Padre].

> From the beginning she was part of the Bella Vista Classist and Combative Current (CCC) and marched with this group in every  event of the social organization. She was a fighter.
> 
> At dawn this Saturday she was savagely murdered at Rueda 5500. The attacker attacked her, took off some of her clothes and hit her on the head until she was killed. Then he walked off in the victim's slippers.
> 
> The femicide of Lorena Riquel was reminiscent of that of Caren Peralta, murdered in a downtown apartment with a blow to the head last February. They were both sex workers. Gabriela, from the Ammar union, said that they are struck by the fact that it is the second femicide by the same method: killed by blows to the head.
> 
> The union of sex workers is accompanying the family and in contact with the Prosecutor's Office. Some of its members decided to go to the scene to find out what happened and the details of the case are really macabre. “They expose the contempt for the life of a woman, who is harassed and fiercely attacked by a man. A clear sample of the worst face of patriarchy”, they described.

A suspect was arrested on 25th August.

> A 32-year-old man was arrested at dawn this Tuesday (25) for being suspected of being the alleged perpetrator of the brutal femicide of Lorena María del Luján Riquel, which occurred last Saturday in Rueda at 5500. He was apprehended in an operation carried out by the Brigade of Homicides of the Criminal Investigation Agency (AIC) in Rio de Janeiro at 2800.
> 
> The detainee, identified as Carlos Daniel B., was found by the security force in front of his home in Rio de Janeiro at 2800. He has a peculiarity: he has a tear tattooed on his left cheekbone. He was transferred to the headquarters of the Criminal Investigation Agency, where he was held incommunicado by order of the criminal homicide prosecutor Georgina Pairola.

Her boyfriend was arrested and subsequently confessed to killing her.

> The father of the young transsexual [woman] Luara Redfield, who was found dead after spending 12 days missing in Mairinque (SP), vented about her daughter's boyfriend after the boy was arrested and confessed to the crime.
> 
> Luis Henrique Leandro Ferreira, who is a pastor, told G1 that he was indignant to learn of the crime and dismissed the possibility of it having been committed out of jealousy. According to the father, they had been together for about six months.
> 
> ""It wasn't just a crime leveraged by jealousy. Killing like that and hiding the corpse from me doesn't fit. He fits into psychopathy. He's devoid of feeling, of love, of compassion. Cold and calculating. A guy totally without feeling. Crossing his path is destruction and death. This is the trail he leaves wherever he goes and has to be caught"", he explains.
> 
> Luara disappeared on August 10 and, on the 22, her body was found in an advanced state of decomposition in Jardim Vitória. Her boyfriend Jhonatan Richard de Lima Moreira, 18, was taken to the police station and confessed to the crime.

Luara was apparently a very good natured person. One of her friends said this about her:

> ""I never met anyone as sweet and someone as good as she was. Even when she was mistreated for being who she was, for being transgender, she remained firm, polite, and never got into a fight.""

> Lua, I know we were not so united and close, in common sense they would call us ""friends of rolê"". I met you 3 years ago at a party in Cidade Tiradentes and since then we have always run into each other. It was always a lot of fun to meet you, you always had an amazing make up and I loved it, when you moved inland I even watched the make up tutorials that you did once in a while on Facebook, always with your humor.
>
> Another thing I followed from afar was your transition process, I always treated you as a female, until then they were how we all treated us, but it was still good to know that I always saw you as you really were. Not so long ago that you posted how happy you were that your breasts were growing ...
>
> The point is, no one deserves to go through what you went through, NOBODY! Your death is still turning my heart over with a lot of pain, you went to São Roque to have a chance, an opportunity. I feel powerless, afraid, absolutely shaken and not much else to be done.

> All that you deserve now is justice, that the authorities do what has to be done to reach the person responsible for all this pain, an LGBTQ + life gone once more, until when?

Subsequently a memorial was built at the location where her body was found.

At the scene, several photos of the young woman with family and friends were spread. In addition, flowers, a flag in the colors of the LGBTQIA + movement and signs with the words ""Trans lives matter"" were also placed.

In December 2020 the artist [Miranda Caê](https://www.facebook.com/mirandacae/) [released the song ""Leve"" [""Light""] in Luara's memory](https://purepop.com.br/miranda-cae-eleva-a-dor-do-luto-em-novo-clipe-sobre-feminicidio-trans/).

She died at the scene.

> This week started in a mood of mourning for the LGBTI community in Curitiba. Isabella Soares, 22 years old, was murdered in the capital of Rio Grande do Sul, in a crime that seems to have been aimed at her companion. Isabella has lived in Canoas since the beginning of the year and may have been killed by mistake.
> 
> According to the police, the man who was in the room with her was the target of a  gang of three men who broke into the San Diego motel in the Ipanema neighborhood and ordered that the door be opened. When this did not happen they fired several shots with a 9mm pistol through a window, hitting Isabella three times. She died on the spot. The crime occurred at around 11 pm on Sunday.
> 
> The 24-year-old who was with her has a criminal record. He hid in the bathroom and was the one who called the Military Brigade after the criminals left the place. The 4th Homicide Police Station in Porto Alegre (4th DPHPP) of the Civil Police investigates the murder. Apparently, in a brief internet search, executions inside motels in Rio Grande do Sul are common.
> 
> It is worth praising the police of Rio Grande do Sul and the Rio Grande do Sul press that did not treat the death of the young trans in a sensationalist way, always referring to her as a woman, without revealing her transsexuality.

Note that some sources name her as Isabella Pedrozo.

Her partner set up the Instagram account https://www.instagram.com/shelleylynnrose/ in her memory.

> “My name is Jeph Stevenson. Shelley Rose was my soulmate, my romantic partner, my best friend for two years, and the reason I am the man I am today. And I’m here to tell her story.
>
> Shelley suffered from gender dysphoria from a very young age, and by the time she was in her teens, it was crippling. In February 2020, she finally came out to me, and I told her I would do everything in my power to get her the affirming care she needed.
>
> The only problem, however, is that her parents were abusive, negligent of her overall declining mental health, and extremely transphobic.
>
> There were so many nights I spent on FaceTime with Shelley, watching her put on makeup, stuff her bra and try to find pieces of clothing that could give her relief from the dysphoria. Her parents, however, threw away all her feminine clothes and the makeup she had bought. All she wanted was to be treated like the beautiful woman she was, and instead, she was met with disgust, abuse and bullying, both from her family and her co-workers at her waitressing job.
>
> Shelley was forced to wear a male uniform, and tuck her long hair into a hat so customers didn’t get “offended”. Older male customers would refuse to give her tips for waiting on their tables, and would complain to her face, “damn, I thought I’d get one of those pretty waitresses.”
>
> On August 26, 2020, Shelley had decided that she couldn’t handle this anymore. She was recently in the process for a diagnosis of PTSD, as well as rapidly developing borderline personality disorder, and she knew she was loosing the fight.
>
> Shelley was always one for symbolism, both in her artwork and the way she interacted with me. She was a hopeless romantic and she always made a big statement with whatever she did.
>
> And that’s why, when she decided to take her own life that evening, she curled up in her closet and passed away. She had been forced into a metaphorical closet her whole life, and so that’s where she chose to die.
>
> Now, she is being buried as a male and her tombstone will have her deadname on it. Shelley deserves better. She deserves to be remembered for the beautiful woman she was, a talented artist, and a singer with the voice of an angel.
>
> I am the only one who was truly close to her. I’m the only one who can get this information out there for the world to see. Please, spread this like wildfire. Let us immortalize her sweet soul so the world can know the true name and identity of the girl who died. #shelleylynnrose“

> 
> When they arrived at the home, around 8 pm, they noticed that the trunk of Jeanine's vehicle was open, a sign that made them believe that she was at home, however, when they got closer they received a strange smell, which they tried to ignore. They yelled out her name several times waiting for her to come out, but she never came. Given the lack of response, they tried to open the main door of the apartment, found it open, and entered calling her. Inside the building, the fetid smell became stronger, and at the entrance they detected traces of blood and found the room in disarray. Everything had been moved and it was clear that some electronic devices had been taken.

Like many trans women in Latin America, Janine was a sex worker by necessity - but she spent most of her time working at [Centro de Servicios Ser AC](https://www.facebook.com/CENTROCSER.AC/posts/2829260963844682) to promote the sexual and reproductive health of trans women.

> “This is how she arrived, looking for a space to feel safe, a space to share with her community, a space to watch over the human rights of the other girls; She always said, I don't want to be part of the statistic, I don't want to be just another statistic, and she always looked for support from the other girls, and let's hope it's not just another statistic, that this time justice will be achieved in her name, ”Padilla said.
> 
> Jeanine always sought to support the trans community, accompanying people who were seeking to change their name and gender on the birth certificate throughout Baja California, whom she advised to carry out their process and the steps to follow.
> 
> “I remember Jeanine as a strong woman, I will always remember her as a proactive woman, always looking for improvement, she worked for a long time in an over-wheel, sold clothes, because there was a resistance in her, in which her story was going to be different, she trusted that there would be working conditions for trans women… She was committed to her community, she did not seek recognition, she always worked behind the scenes”, noted the director of Centro Servicios Ser.

Three weeks after the murder, Darío Jesús Chaves Rubio, 31, - a police officer - was arrested.

> Almost three weeks after the violent crime and following the analysis of security cameras in the area and the testimony of witnesses, the provincial Public Prosecutor's Office requested the arrest of the possible murderer: Darío Jesús Chaves Rubio (31), Principal Assistant of Police Station 34 of the Banking District of Godoy Cruz , who from now on must face a serious accusation.
>
> The Prosecutor of Instruction Carolina Lazo, of the Mendoza Homicide Fiscal Unit, charged him with the crime of homicide aggravated by hatred of gender expression in an ideal contest with homicide aggravated by the use of a firearm , and in a real contest for quarantine violation. This strong accusation places the cash in front of the possibility of a life sentence.
>
> Key to the arrest of the suspect was the statement of a witness who claimed to have met him before the crime and who had told him that he was going ""to look for a gun and shoot the transvestite” - clear evidence that the murder was a transphobic hate crime.

When picking up her belongings her mother found a letter denouncing the conditions there.

Lea was homeless at the time of her arrest.

> In Cleveland, Ohio, a 28-year-old transgender woman, who died in her cell at Cuyahoga County Jail last month, left a hidden letter denouncing the jail’s horrid conditions. The letter was found by her mother after picking up her daughter’s belongings. In the letter, Lea Daye wrote prisoners were served food that was cold, smelled bad and tasted like cleaning chemicals. Daye said the jail also failed to provide cleaning supplies and that the conditions had only gotten worse during the COVID-19 pandemic.


At a virtual press conference on 4th September local community representative expressed their anger over conditions at the jail.

> Anger over the tragic death of 28-year-old Lea Rayshon Daye in Cleveland’s Cuyahoga County Jail came out forcefully in a virtual press conference held Sept. 4. Daye’s was the second jail death here in less than two months and the 11th in two years. Found unresponsive in her cell Aug. 30, the Black trans woman died in a city deemed “an epicenter for America’s trans murder crisis” by an Aug. 17 op-ed piece in the Cleveland Scene.
> 
> Like Michael Wormick, who died in the same jail on July 8, Daye was houseless at the time of her arrest. Her death spotlighted the intersectionality of racism, transphobia, poverty and mass incarceration.
> 
> The news conference featured speakers on all these issues, including representatives of the Coalition to Stop the Inhumanity at the Cuyahoga County Jail, Northeast Ohio Coalition for the Homeless (NEOCH), Equality Ohio, Trans Ohio and the LGBT Community Center of Greater Cleveland.
>
> Rev. Reegie Bunch of the Jail Coalition condemned “the final indignity of misgendering” by jail authorities and then the news media. Ellie Turan, the Community Center’s Director of Development and author of the above mentioned op-ed, called Daye’s death “an extension of lynching.” Gwen Stembridge of Equality Ohio pointed out that half of all Black trans women spend time in prison, and Chris Knestrick of NEOCH added that 30% of transgender people experience homelessness and declared that “housing is a human right.”
> 
> Devinity Jones, founder and coordinator of the Community Center’s Trans Wellness Program, spoke movingly about her own experiences with the so-called “justice system.” When she appeared in court to pay a fine, a transphobic judge wrongfully sentenced her to 60 days in jail after making blatantly bigoted comments. In jail, she was subjected to a range of abuses.
> 
> Jones was celled with a cisgender male prisoner. Like numerous other prisoners she slept on a mat on the floor, was fed horrible food, had inadequate medical care, was denied basic hygiene and was abused by the vicious guards known as “the men in black.” A guard sexually assaulted her while she was taking a shower. Several years ago her friend Mahogany, also a Black trans woman, died in jail when authorities denied her anti-seizure medication.


On 3rd September the statement below had been released by the [North East Ohio Coalition for the Homeless](https://www.neoch.org/):
 
> Cleveland, OH, September 2, 2020—The Coalition to Stop the Inhumanity at the Cuyahoga County Jail, Equality Ohio, The Northeast Ohio Coalition for the Homeless, and The LGBT Community Center of Greater Cleveland decries the loss of another life at the Cuyahoga Jail: Lea Rayshon Daye, a black trans woman. At only 28 years old, she was found unresponsive by correctional officers early Sunday morning. Lea joins ten other people who have passed away in the Cuyahoga County Jail, which has been called “the worst in the country” by the US Marshals inspection report. 
> 
> “Transgender people are being murdered across the United States and the City of Cleveland has one of the highest rates based on our population,” said Maya Simekfrom Equality Ohio. “The system that continues to fail Black, brown and LGBTQ+ Ohioans is completely inept when interacting with those at the intersection of race and LGBTQ+ identity by not protecting them, especially in state custody.”
> 
> After society failed Lea, the final indignity was being misgendered in death. Lea spent the last 105 days of her life in the custody of a system that could not even afford her the basic dignity of releasing and reporting to the public her correct name and gender after her passing. Those that knew her said that she would have hated that.  
> 
> With reports about increased “red zoning,” a practice of locking people down for 27 or more hours in their cells and withholding basic hygiene items, it is clear that the issues within our jail have not been addressed. The jail population hovers around 1,000 people and even though the staff has increased to a robust size, we have seen two more inmate deaths in the last month alone and the death of a correctional officer who contracted COVID-19 while working at the jail. 
> 
> “Even the cleanest and most well-staffed jail in the world is still a predatory and abusive institution, and the vast majority of inmates incarcerated long-term in county jails are there due to an inability to afford bail, escape poverty, or access social services,” said  Chrissy Stonebraker-Martinez from the Cuyahoga County Jail Coalition. “A cottage industry of bail bonds has risen up to prey upon the desperation of these individuals and posts record profits every year. It is for this reason that cash bail must be abolished entirely.”
> 
> “The last two people who died in jail had experienced homelessness and these deaths at the county jail cannot become routine.” said Chris Knestrick from the Northeast Ohio Coalition for the Homeless. “Like the lives lost through police murder, mass shootings, and the covid pandemic, these are not isolated instances. They are symptoms of the deep systemic rot that places property and profit above human life and human dignity.”  
> 
> We call on our community, elected officials, and non-profit organizations to honor those whose lives were cut short by demanding justice and accountability. The victims of the Cuyahoga County Jail should not be forgotten and black trans lives should not be erased. Join us in fighting for a fairer, freer, and more equitable justice system in Cuyahoga County. 
> 
> “There is a direct correlation between the uprisings regarding racial equity and the increased public awareness about the murdering of trans people,” said Ellie Turan, the Director of Development at the LGBT Community Center of Greater Cleveland. “The time we are living in is creating a spark that's causing people to see the murders of our trans neighbors as a major problem.”
> 
> We will honor their lives prior to the moment they were ended at the Cuyahoga County Jail. We ask our community to join us in saying their names: Theodore Carter. Allan Martin. Gomez Roman. Randall Kain. Larry Johnson. Brenden Kiekisz. Nicholas Colbert. Joseph Arquillo. Esteban Parra. Gregory Fox. Michael Wormick. Lea Daye.

She had been hit by a train.

> LAKEWOOD, Ohio (WJW) — Lakewood police are investigating after a woman was struck and killed by a train on Sunday.
> 
> According to the department, officers were notified around 4:45 p.m. that someone had been hit by a westbound train. While searching the area, they discovered a woman’s body near the railroad tracks just west of [1313] Cove Avenue.
> 
> No other details about the incident were made available.

Eliana Turan, Director Of Development at The LGBT Community Center of Greater Cleveland said:

> ""Transgender woman Rukia Isis Bemer died around the same time as Lea. The authorities found her body on railroad tracks in the inner Cleveland suburb of Lakewood, very near where I live. She was only 22.
> 
> We still do not know if she died of suicide, or if it was an accident or foul play.

According to the police report, video recorded from the train shows her walking eastbound towards the westbound train - with her head up and wearing earphones. The train blew its whistle continuously before hitting her.

> 
> As many of you know I had a terrible face feminising surgery last year with dr jesus baez marquez. 
> 
> He kept me 15 hours in the operating room just for forehead and nose surgery (I guess he could not finish the surgery and he had to get some help from other surgeons outside) . 
> 
> I had serious side effects after the surgery (I had infection and I was almost blind for 2 months . in Those two months I could not work. I could not even go for shopping. Once I went to the doctor and I could not find Uber because I could not see the plate number).
> 
> The saddest part of this story was the surgery result. The more that I waited for the final result, the more my face looked unusual.
> 
> There was a hole in the middle of the forehead with sharp angles on eyebrows , deeper set eyes and too much inconsistency between left and right. There was a very bad scare under my nose (it is still clear adter one year).
> 
> I went to many FFS surgeons to ask for revision so I look like human again . All of them rejected me because the damage on the bones structure were not fixable.

Police are treating her death as homicide.

> From Santa Maria, in the Central Region, where she lived, Melani Aguiar, 20, left in late August to go to Santa Cruz do Sul, in the Rio Pardo Valley. She left her puppy Benhurin the care of her uncles, telling family members that she would return a few days later, but she could keep her promise.
> 
> On August 27 she was hospitalized after feeling sick while applying industrial silicone to her body but did not survive. The investigation of the death of the transsexual led the Civil Police to unveil a clandestine market in which cosmetic procedures are carried out with prohibited products, at low cost and with health risks.
> 
> From the beginning, the investigation treated Melani's death as a homicide. But the police only knew that the victim had been subjected to the application of industrial silicone - of use prohibited by the National Health Surveillance Agency (Anvisa) in the human body because of the risks - and that the complications had led to her death. This product, used, for example, in the mechanical area and in constructions, when applied to the body can cause injuries and even death. It happened to the young woman.
> 
> Melani suffered from a septic syndrome, which is multiple organ dysfunction. The silicone, as it is liquid, ended up spreading throughout her body - explained police officer Ana Luísa Aita Pippi, from the 1st Police Station in Santa Cruz do Sul.

Marcella de Sales was charged as a result of her death.

> According to the complaint filed by the Public Prosecutor's Office at the end of October, Marcella had traveled to the Rio Pardo Valley to apply the silicone to Melani. The young woman died four days later on August 31 after being hospitalized. The Civil Police investigation revealed a scheme for the application of industrial silicone to women in several municipalities in Rio Grande do Sul. When interrogated during the investigation, Marcella confessed that she was responsible for applying the product to the victim. As she is the primary defendant and collaborated with the investigation, the police did not request her arrest.
>
> The prosecutor Flávio Eduardo de Lima Passos alleges that the accused assumed the risk of killing the victim when performing the procedure that produced her injuries. She was however not charged with the illegal practice of medicine, a crime for which she had been already been indicted by the Civil Police.
