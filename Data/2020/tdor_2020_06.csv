Koko attended Dr. Pedro Albizu Campos High School, who held a memorial event for her on Friday. She worked at Oberweis Creamery, described herself as “a makeup artist in the making.” and was a fan of the Kardashians.

> Her Twitter profile reads:
>
> “Hey guys and gals. I love the Kardashians/Jenners. My favorite word is Bible. I love Fashion and makeup. Peace out.”

Given how she was dressed when she died, we can only assume that the misgendering by the police and morgue were acts of stubborn institutional transphobia - and ones which most certainly hindered her identification. As Sue Kerr of [Pittsburgh Lesbian Correspondents](https://www.pghlesbian.com/2021/04/body-of-19-year-old-chicago-black-trans-woman-found-in-june-2020-finally-identified-in-april-2021) so eloquently puts it:

> I struggle to understand that the police did not even consider that her identity was female or nonbinary especially given that she was wearing clothing considered women’s, including Pink-Colored Lycra Shorts. That resonates so visually in my mind. I flashback to the 2013 murder of [Cemia Dove](https://tdor.translivesmatter.info/reports/2013/01/05/cemia-dove-acoff-ce-ce_olmsted-township-cleveland-ohio-usa_8dd890ae) whose body was found tied to concrete while “clad in a red Betty Boop tank top, three black bras and a light black hooded jacket.” Beyond the deliberate indignity, I carry just this intense memory of the colors.

> Sometime during the night between the 12th and the 13th of June a 26-year-old trans woman lost her life as a result of a stabbing at Vantaa, Finland. The victim’s memory was insulted by both the police and the media. The press release put out by the police misgendered the victim and the media, despite having received new information from a number of trans rights organizations that challenged the police narrative, did not correct their news reports that misgendered the victim. Organizations dedicated to advancing the rights of transgender people in Finland demand that both the authorities and the media take responsibility, follow their legal duties and correct their mistakes. Additionally, both the media and the authorities must treat transgender people with dignity and in a sensitive manner in the future. Equal treatment of trans people is enshrined in Finnish law and must be respected.
>
> The police were very late in putting out a press release concerning the Vantaa homicide and in their report they misgendered the victim, calling her a man. The police also admitted to having forgotten to send out a press release about the homicide. According to people close to the victim and her public social media profiles she had been living out and proud as a woman for several years. In the Vantaa homicide the alleged perpetrator, a man in his 30s, stabbed a woman late in the night. The crime was a murder of a woman belonging to a marginalized group, not an “argument between men”, as the press release sent out by the police framed it.
>
> Misgendering of transgender people in death is still very common and the fear of being remembered by a name that is not yours or in a gender you don’t belong to lives painfully in the hearts of many transgender people. Misgendering, especially at a point when the victim can no longer defend themselves and request it to be corrected, is the final hostile act that people who hold negative or even hostile views towards transgender people can commit, thus insulting the deceased. Due to Finland’s current legislation concerning transgender people many Finnish trans people cannot correct their gender markers on public documents and are therefore forced to use the incorrect gender marker assigned at birth in all official matters. As the Vantaa homicide proves, the current state of Finnish trans legislation has serious effects on the human rights of victims of serious crimes.

>Cuernavaca, Mor.- The State Attorney General's Office (FGE) concluded the autopsy on the body of María Elizabeth “N”, 47 years old, trans doctor of the XXI Century National Medical Center of the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) and strengthened the hypothesis of suicide by taking medication.
>
> After the LGBT activist has been missing since June 8, and her body was found on the side of the Mexico-Cuernavaca federal highway, the FGE reported that pathology studies began and sent tissue samples to specialized laboratories to define the ingested compounds and it was the corresponding damage to the organs that led to her death.
>
> ""Investigations at the time, and according to statements by her own relatives, María Elizabeth had expressed her desire to deprive herself of life and it is through an email scheduled to be received after her disappearance that she left a posthumous message to her relatives,” the FGE reported in a statement.

María had studied medicine at La Salle University and specialised in emergency treatment, but reputedly she was also a very effective teacher, activist and educator.

> MEXICO CITY - Dr. María Elizabeth Montaño Fernández liked to use an allegory to explain what gender is: she fixed her deep gaze on the audience and asked her to imagine a man named Alfred going out on the street one bad day and He was run over by a car.
>
> The vehicle cut Alfred in half, and although the doctors managed to save his life, he was amputated from the waist down. ""Even though that man has lost his genitals, is he still a man?"" Montaño asked with bright eyes during a debate held on September 28, 2019. ""Of course we do, because what makes us men or women is not what we have between our legs, but our brain.""

> “Burcu was one of the few special people you can meet and meet in life. People have always given them rainbows on rainy days. Now we have lost a color of the rainbow. What we have lived, lived, and lived deserves to be shared; And one day they become light on a person's path to darkness. Memories are treasures, Burcu. You were a colorful light, now you will sleep in those lights. ""Light is in your heart, and you will find your way home.""

> “A very young, very beautiful person with infinite potential who was in a lot of pain. Oh my dear girl, my dear friend… I wish I had suffered. I wish I had the strength to give you a world where you can be happy. Being hostile to oneself is the most unfortunate event that can happen to a person. The love of others alone is not enough to save you. You have to learn to love yourself. I want to believe that trans sisters protect and guide her wherever she goes. I know we will meet again one day. May your soul find peace, my beautiful face, my sensitive heart.""

According to her, the association is raising more information about what happened and should comment later.
>
A team from the Mobile Emergency Care Service (Samu) was called, started first aid, but the [trans woman] died in the vehicle before being taken to the emergency room. The body was taken to the Legal Medical Institute (IML) for cadaveric procedures.

According to ANTRA (the National Association of Transvestites and Transsexuals) this was the first case of homicide of a trans person in Acre since 2019.

> The trans struggle is not just a body, it is about the right and the courage to exist. But, to exist with dignity, freedom and, above all, respect. For every transgender person murdered, not only are lives lost, dreams and hopes are also lost. Fernanda left, and took with her the desire to live fully in a more humane and conscious society, leaving behind revolt and sadness, feelings that we must transform into forces to continue with her struggle.

> The Conservix team wishes strength to family and friends. Fernanda Machado, present!

A week before her death Fernanda had recorded a video with her mother for Pride.

> Today, on International LGBT Pride Day, friends and family show why they are proud of LGBT people. Unfortunately, this video also reveals that the violence against this audience is real.
>
> Fernanda Machado, a 27 year old [trans woman], was murdered in Rio Branco, one week after participating in the recordings. Prejudice and intolerance cannot continue to rape, kill and make these people feel ashamed of who they are.
>
> Brazil is one of the most violent countries for the LGBT population, with a violent death every 26 hours, according to a survey by the Gay Group of Bahia.
>
> MPAC reaffirms its role so that no one is discriminated against for their sexual orientation or gender identity.

In the video Fernanda's mother, Raimunda Nonata, says she is proud of her daughter and talks about the love she feels for her:

> “I am proud to have my daughter, I have no prejudice, I love her as she is. For me it will always be my beloved daughter. I love her so much"".
>
> Then the two embrace. The video also features a speech by Fernanda in one of the actions of the MP, where she says that it is necessary to educate society to combat violence against the LGBTQIA + community.
>
> **“A lot of LGBT people are killed in Brazil and around the world. Brazil today is the country that kills the most, not only physically, but with words. So, as I speak again, educating and informing people is paramount. I don't raise a flag, I don't raise an acronym, I raise love. This is what I defend, this is what we must defend”**, she said.

On Monday 3rd August two suspects were arrested.

> The Civil Police Acre, through the Police for the Protection of the Person (DHPP), after a thorough investigation work, managed to arrest in the early afternoon of this Monday, 3, Vitor Alexandre da Silva Junqueira, 19 years old, and Rafael Kevin Araújo Braga, 21 years old, involved in the death of [trans woman] Fernanda Machado da Silva, 27 years old. Fernanda was beaten to death at dawn on June 25, 2020 on Rua Minas Gerais, in the Preventório neighborhood in Rio Branco.

On 30th April 2021 Rafael Kewiw Braga and Vitor Alexandre Junqueira were each sentenced to 19 years and 10 months for her murder.

> The two accused of killing [trans woman] Fernanda Machado da Silva with a club in June last year were sentenced to sentences that add up to almost 40 years in prison. The decision, by the Criminal Court of Criminal Organizations, was released by the Court of Justice of Acre on Friday (30) and is yet to be published in the Official Gazette.
>
> Rafael Kewiw Braga and Vitor Alexandre Junqueira were sentenced to individual sentences of 19 years and 10 months in prison for the crimes of torture resulting in death, corruption of minors and criminal organization and must comply with the initial closed regime.

> A [trans woman] was murdered with a knife in a bus at the Santa Rita Pier Terminal at dawn on Thursday (25). According to the police, the victim, who appeared to be 30, was stabbed at least six times.
>
> The crime took place on a Marcos Freire / Bacurau bus. The bus driver, who preferred not to identify himself, told the TV Jornal report that the [trans woman] tried to protect herself from the killer on the bus. 
>
“I had the vehicle stopped to leave at 3 am, which was what was expected, when the [trans woman] ran onto the bus, asking for help. It happened so fast that before I could close the door her assailant got on and started stabbing her. I yelled at him not to do that and jumped out of the vehicle to look for another vehicle to call for help. But, unfortunately, it was too late, I was not able to save her”, reported the bus driver.
>
> The victim, who identified herself as ""Lady Gaga"", died on the spot. The suspect was still found at the terminal with the bloodied knife used. He confessed to the crime. Also according to the driver, the [trans woman] was killed because of jealousy.

The motive appeared to be anger because Gaga was encouraging the assailant's wife to leave him. Perhaps Gaga knew he was violent and that she was in danger too - we'll probably never know.

> “It was out of jealousy because the people here started saying that the guy who murdered the [trans woman] said he was doing it because she shouldn't have messed with his wife. She was trying to persuade this guy's wife to leave him, and in a way, she was finding other people for her to relate to. ”
>
> The victim's friend, who also declined to be identified, says that the fight between the killer and the [trans woman] started around midnight. She came to sense her own death. 
>
> “She came to me and said, 'let me stay here because I'm going to die today'. I told her 'stay here'. But the other one came, the guy who was demonized and pulled her by the hair. He dragged her through her hair until she managed to get to the bus and then he stabbed her inside the bus,” he said.
>
> The arrested suspect was identified as Daniel José de Freitas, 22. In addition to him, a teenager of 17 was apprehended. They were taken to the Homicide and Personal Protection Department (DHPP) in the neighborhood of Cordeiro, West Zone of Recife, where they were fined in the act.

Merci Mack,22,9-Apr-1998,2020_06_30_Merci-Mack.jpg,https://twitter.com/thxitsthetrauma/status/1278318815634432000,30-Jun-2020,tgeu/30-Jun-2020/Merci Mack,"Oak Cliff, Dallas",Texas,USA,32.6954731,-96.7718053,violence,shot,"Merci was found unconscious and with gunshot wounds in the parking lot of an apartment complex after neighbours had reported hearing gunfire. She died at the scene.

> Her name was Merci Mack. She was a 22-year-old Black trans woman living in Dallas. She had a job, a car, family, and friends. Her social media posts were playful, blunt, and hopeful.
>
> On Tuesday, the final day of Pride month, she was found dead from gunshot wounds in the parking lot of an apartment complex [at the 3000 block of East Ledbetter Drive]. It was 6:15 AM. Neighbors reported hearing gunfire around 5 AM.

> The final day of Pride month, in the midst of a nationwide uprising for racial justice, a young Black trans woman loses her life to gunfire. I remember yesterday, remember looking at the Google Doodle of Marsha P. Johnson, one of the most revered Black trans women in LGBTQIA history. And I weep thinking that 50+ years later, our trans neighbors particularly our trans BIPOC sisters are still bearing the brunt of the oppression. That we are grieving 22 year olds and 17 year olds.
>
> Merci is the 17th violent death of a transgender person in the US during 2020. Eight of those neighbors were 25 or younger, including Merci who was 22. Another young Texas trans woman was shot to death in early May.
>
> Like so many others, Merci has been deadnamed and misgendered by law enforcement and police. You might notice its ‘not as bad’ as it has been, but if she can’t have respect in these final days after enduring so much violence – when?

> “Merci was loved,” Shannon Walker, the founder of Nu Trans Movement, an advocacy group for trans people in Dallas, told Buzzfeed. “Her family loved her. Her dad, her mom, loved her unconditionally, and that is rare to see in the Black community when it comes to young Black trans folk.”

On 10th July it was reported that a suspect had been arested.

> Angelo Walker, 20, was arrested by the North Texas Fugitive Task Force this week. An anonymous witness came forward and said they saw Walker chase Mack through the apartment complex lot and then stand over her and fire multiple shots, according to the arrest affidavit.

Reportedly Walker had known her since childhood.

Very little is known about what happened to her - possibly due to deadnaming by police and media.

> Tatiana Hall was one of the three Black trans women murdered in the past week, along with Brayla Stone and Merci Mack.
>
> Very little has been reported on the murder of the 21-year-old from Irvington, New Jersey, but posts of her name have been circulating throughout Instagram and Twitter.
>
> According to T Time Network, a New York City-based LGBTQ+ platform that centers on trans women of color, Tatiana’s body was found in Philadelphia and not New Jersey, where she was originally reported dead. 
>
> “While the rest of #lgbtq was enjoying gay liberation, this is what pride was for black transwomen ...another day in the battlefield.”
>
> People have expressed fear that part of the reason people cannot find more coverage of her death is because she was deadnamed in police reports and by local media. “Deadnaming” refers to when a trans person’s birth name is used instead of  the name they chose for themselves.
