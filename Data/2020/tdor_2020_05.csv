>
> The Human Rights Campaign called for action to address violence against trans Americans. “For the past four weeks, we have seen the deaths of five transgender women of color in this country. We are seeing an epidemic of violence that can no longer be ignored. Transgender and gender-nonconforming people, especially trans women of color, risk our lives by living as our true selves — and we are being violently killed for doing so,” Tori Cooper, director of community engagement for HRC’s Transgender Justice Initiative, said in a blog post.
>
> “We must be outraged by this news and we must channel that outrage into action immediately. These crimes must be reported, investigated and prosecuted. These lives must be mourned, honored and fought for. What we are doing is not enough. HRC mourns alongside all those who know and loved Nina, and we will continue our tireless fight to ensure a future where living one’s truth can never become a death sentence.”

> Transgender woman Helle Jae O'Regan has been identified as the victim of a workplace rampage that claimed her life and injured two others in San Antonio on 6th May.
>
> 20-year-old Helle was employed at Diesel Barbershop in San Antonio, Texas, where the incident took place.
>
> According to police statements and media reports, 42-year-old Damion Campbell entered the barbershop to book an appointment whilst staff were preparing the premises to re-open, but when asked to provide payment he left the store, before returning with weapons. He was seen in surveillance video holding both a knife and a gun, and threatened the three members of staff present.
>
> Two of Helle's fellow employees were able to escape, one without injuries whilst the other received several stab wounds. According to the police, Campbell choked Helle unconscious before stabbing her to death. Police have said that they do not believe Helle's gender played a role in her death.
>
> Helle has been described as a proud trans woman, who embraced her identity. On the Trans Day of Visibility she posted to her Instagram account where she shared pictures of her transition. 'I wasn't going to post anything but it's #transdayofvisibility so I decided I will. I was looking at the pictures I used to take before I transitioned versus now and it made me realize I'm way happier than I used to be. I love myself now. Thank you to everyone who's ever supported me and to anyone who hasn't I hope you come around. I'm happy and proud to be myself.' The post said.

After her murder friends and colleagues set up an impromptu memorial outside the barbershop.

> Luke Tyler and Harvest Barry stopped by the barbershop where O’Regan was killed to add flowers to the growing memorial. They say she was a beautiful human and kind to everyone she met.
>
> “Every time I saw her, she smiled. She’d do anything for you,” Tyler said. “She was a caring person. I never saw her in a bad mood.”
>
> “If he had just met her, I’m sure he wished he could take it all back. It’s just sick,” Tyler said about the murder suspect.
>
> O’Regan’s friends say Campbell unfairly took a great human away from this world. “Being trans is so hard, and her life was hard, but she lived like it was the best day of her life every day,” Tyler said.

No charges were filed against the officer concerned.

> Jayne Thompson, a 33-year-old transgender woman, was shot and killed by a police officer on May [9]. The shooting made her the 12th trans person to lose their life to fatal violence in 2020, but that fact remained unknown for weeks after Thompson was misgendered by police and local media.
>
> The shooting took place in Orchard Mesa, Colorado after Thompson was reported unresponsive in the vicinity of Orchard Mesa Market, a local grocery store located along a busy intersection [U.S. Highway 50 and 29 Road]. According to details provided to local media by the Mesa County Sheriff's Office, Thompson remained motionless for hours and did not respond when approached by passersby offering assistance.
>
> Following a 911 call, Colorado State Trooper Jason Wade attempted to intervene. That’s when KKCO, a local NBC affiliate, reports that Thompson “began to act aggressively and displayed a 10-inch knife.” “Investigators say that is when the shooting happened,” the outlet claims.
>
> Although the officer was not harmed during the interaction, Thompson was killed.
>
> Thompson’s death coincided with the killings of two trans women in the same week: a 31-year-old Nina Pop in Sikeston, Missouri and 20-year-old Helle Jae O’Regan in San Antonio, Texas, both of whom were stabbed to death. To date, 15 transgender people have lost their lives to fatal violence in 2020, the majority of whom were Black trans women. Thompson, an outlier on the list, was white.
>
> But Thompson’s gender identity was not adequately recognized for weeks after she was misgendered and deadnamed in initial reports regarding the incident. KDVR, a local Fox affiliate, corrected its coverage following updated information from the Mesa County Coroner’s Office, but Thompson is still referred to by a male name and with male pronouns in the Denver Post, Grand Junction Daily Sentinel, and KMGH, a local ABC news affiliate.
>
> Tori Cooper, director of community engagement for HRC’s Transgender Justice Initiative, claimed that Thompson’s treatment by the media and local authorities is “appalling.” She noted in a statement that it took local media outlets “over a month to correctly identify Jayne with her correct name and pronouns.”
>
> Cooper also suggested that Thompson’s death could have been prevented had the officer focused on deescalating the situation.
> 
> The situation is not dissimilar to that of Tony McDade, a 38-year-old Black transgender man who was shot and killed on May 27 by Tallahassee police. McDade was reportedly experiencing extreme mental distress in the hours leading up to his death and had struggled with mental illness throughout his life.

> A letter from @leandrinhadu about Demétrio. She and all Ninja send strength to friends and family.
>
> Demétrio lit and shone for the world and went out before our eyes. If we were introduced, we never greet or spoke and it didn't even have to feel the power that his body transmitted was enough to look closely at him, Demétrio was art from the plant from feet to hair, watching him dance, with my own eyes discovered this, energy and life came out of his black skin.
>
> The truth? The truth is that while the young man shone he begged for attention, asked for help, it was deception and my mistake, Demétrio did not escape the weight and pressure of being a trans man black
>
> At different times, like me, he accumulated in his body several oppressions, violence and decline that the society in which we live put in our arms the clippings drastically hit his mind. Demétrio is dead, he's dead! Y ' all feel what I feel? Without knowing him I feel like we fail him, I breathe and the air doesn't come to me, I feel like we fail the people on our side, close my eyes and I feel like I avoid noticing the sadness of others. Are there people at this very moment asking for help with small gestures and we are sensitive to help, listen, be close, be present? When are we going to talk about trans people's mental health? When are we going to talk about black people's lives? When will we talk about care to the next one?
Demétrio was not the last, be aware of this and Demétrio needs to be alive in our head so that we can feel this sorrow and reflect on our lives and how we are taking care of each other.

Trans people in Chivilcoy and elsewhere expressed their dismay at her death, blaming the economic problems she was enduring.

> Condolences were sent from various points in Argentina, as well as complaints about the social situation this community is enduring, which is aggravated by the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.

>
> ""We want to express our pain for the loss of comrade Pilar, it was not an unexpected death, our organization got tired of screaming that this was going to happen, in the blessed meetings of the advisory council for the implementation of the labor quota for trans people and that never we could get to nothing ”.
>
> “Compañeras did enter, yes, but for [help for] Pilar we asked a thousand times, seeing how they were killing compañeras from other provinces. Pilar did not kill herself, Pilar was killed by everyone and those who had the power of decision, she cried out for a registered job, they never gave it to her, she cried out for an opportunity without knowing if she was going to be able to hold it, but she would be responsible if she did not. She managed, shouting she asked and asked again and again but no one listened to us, no one listened to her and she got tired, in this quarantine that grabbed us without notice to anyone, but that left our trans comrades in a state of absolute abandonment. Pilar did not kill Pilar. Those who had the power to decide to help her killed her when they did not do so. ”
>
> ""May Pilar Albarracín rest, our city is in mourning, overwhelming but supportive and with a heart of gold, when she began to tell her story in the first person we all ended up crying and that was the true Pilar, the rest was all a facade, Always in our hearts"".

> Pilar Albarracín was a trans woman, she was from our city, Chivilcoy, she was just 30 years old and a life ahead.

>
> To be able to work is to have the possibility of an economic sustenance but also a routine, colleagues and co-workers, a social work and a retirement in the future.
>

The Florida Police Department claimed that he pulled a gun on police and had a ""bloodied knife"", but eyewitness accounts contradict this.

> The official police report into the fatal shooting of Back trans man Tony McDade has been thrown into doubt as new eyewitnesses accounts emerge.
>
> Tony McDade was shot and killed by an unnamed white police officer in Tallahassee, north Florida, on May 27. He died shortly afterwards in hospital, his death marking Florida’s third fatal police shooting in the last two months.
>
> Local news, which along with the Florida Police Department initially misgendered McDade, reported that he was a suspect in a fatal stabbing.
>
> Speaking at a news briefing last week, Tallahassee Police chief Lawrence Revell said that the suspect fled the scene on foot and was confronted by officers on nearby Holton Street in the Leon apartment complex.
>
> “Our officer called out, ‘Shots fired.’ He said over the radio that the suspect had pointed a gun at him. The suspect was in possession of a handgun, and a bloody knife was found at the scene of the stabbing.”
>
> However, multiple reports by local news said that McDade was unarmed and had not been warned before the officer began shooting. This is corroborated by those at the scene, who say the police never announced themselves as police before firing.

Tony seems to have committed what is known as “suicide by cop"" to avoid being sent back to prison.

> Tony McDade, a black trans man was shot and killed in an apparent attempt to end his life. McDade a twice-convicted felon had been beaten by five men took revenge by killing one of them. To avoid going back to prison Tony committed what is known as “suicide by cop.”
>
> This is all well documented.
>
> We still don’t know the name of the officer who shot McDade or what happened just before he was killed. One witness says that a man jumped out of his car and shot him without identifying himself as law enforcement.
>
> Crucially, we don’t know if the officer who shot McDade was prone to preemptive violence or if he had ever been indicted for murder.  The Tallahassee Police Department is keeping that information from the public using a hijacked version of a victim’s rights law.
>
> Cops who kill in Florida and North Dakota can now keep their names from the public with “Marsy’s Law”.  All that  Florida and North Dakota GOP needed to do to protect their killer cops was the deletion of a couple of words.
>
> And according to Pro Publica, the law has increasingly been co-opted by police nationwide. It got on Florida’s ballot in 2018 after being introduced by a sheriff and revised with the help of two statewide law enforcement associations. Officers say it allows them to claim victim status in use-of-force cases where they say the suspect was the aggressor.
>
> A Tallahassee police officer brought the problems with Marsy’s Law to light in May when he claimed victimhood status after fatally shooting Tony McDade, a Black transgender man who allegedly stabbed a neighbor’s son to death before pointing a gun at the officer.

Yenifer León,33,,2020_05_27_Yenifer-Leon.jpg,https://elpais.com/internacional/2020-06-09/yenifer-ansiaba-consagrarse-a-la-orisha-yemaya-cuando-la-muerte-la-atrapo-en-moscu.html,27-May-2020,,Moscow,Moscow,Russia,55.751634,37.618704,medical,COVID-19,"Yenifer died in hospital from viral pneumonia. She was visiting from Cuba, became trapped in Moscow during the pandemic lockdown and then ran out of money for her HIV medication.

> Yenifer, 33, had come to Moscow from Cuba ""on a shopping spree,"" as she told a newspaper on April 22. It was the second time. The previous one, a couple of years ago, brought three suitcases loaded with T-shirts, underwear and kitchenware to the island. The 120 kilos of rigor in goods that the authorities allow Cubans to take to the country. On the island, where the shortage of products increases in value, she sold the material and made a profit. She wanted to repeat the operation to which a good part of the 25,000 Cubans who enter Russia each year are dedicated, and which has become so frequent that it has illuminated an entire irregular infrastructure - housing in flats, transportation, procedures, passages - around to that business.
>
> But the pandemic came. The closing of borders. The self-isolation regime in the Russian capital. The digital pass system to move around the city. Yenifer and thousands of other Cubans were stranded in Moscow. And she ran out of money. And the antiretroviral drugs she was taking. And the roach-filled apartment she lived in was coming down on him. I was worried. Unlike many other Cubans who come to Russia to stay - some, deceived by the mafias with the promise of a job or the commitment to cross them to Europe - Yenifer wanted to return to the Caribbean island. She had insistently called the Cuban consulate without receiving any response, she said. She was afraid of the police, of discrimination for being trans, black, and having HIV.
>
> ""I can not take anymore. On Monday I will request discharge, ”said one of the last messages from the AE Rabujin tuberculosis hospital in Moscow. ""Blessings! They already did the analyzes and the plates, now to wait for results, ”said another, edged with emoticons. her favorite: the little face that sends a heart-shaped kiss.
>
> On May 5 she began to feel bad. A journey then began through the ins and outs of the Russian health system that ends with those unanswered calls to her mobile. Yenifer was admitted to Moscow's infectious hospital number 2. It was suspected that she could be infected with coronavirus, but the tests were negative. She was diagnosed with viral pneumonia but from other causes, she then explained by phone. She was there for 23 days. She did not speak Russian and could only communicate with the Google translator, says Anna Voronkova, a volunteer who collaborates independently to help the Cuban community. “Sher case exemplifies that if you don't know the language or the rules, if you don't know how to navigate the paper bureaucracy, it's as if you don't have rights. And even more so if you are a trans woman in a country like Russia, ”says Voronkova, who regrets the low collaboration of the Cuban consular authorities.in a time of need for the global health crisis. The system thus rests precariously on the shoulders of volunteers and specialized NGOs without which the most vulnerable would not have assistance.
>
> On March 22, when she thought she was going to be discharged, she was sent to the Rabujin Hospital. She had been diagnosed with tuberculosis. She remained there for five days. When Voronkova called the center less than a week later, she was told that she had died a few hours ago. That she had two-thirds of her lungs badly damaged.
>
> Her family is still waiting for more information from the Cuban consular authorities. ""We are devastated, nobody tells us anything,"" laments her mother, Carmen Cárdenas, by phone from Jovellanos, east of Havana. She was a single mother, she says, and although she has another daughter and is a great support, she was very close to Yenifer. She explains that she wants to repatriate the body and her belongings, but that she cannot explain if it is possible and how.

She died 40 minutes after they left.

> At midnight this Friday, the death of a transgender woman in the town of Santa Fe, in Bogotá, who was known as Alejandra, was reported. They reported that she was not treated in time by the emergency services, pointing out that the Paramedics in an ambulance refused to transfer her to a healthcare facility.
>
> The Trans Community Network documented, through social networks, writing what happened to this woman, who worked as a sex worker in the city center, and explained that the doctors did not help her because she was a carrier of HIV-positiv.
>
> ""At 3 in the morning, Alejandra, a trans sex worker from the Santa Fe neighborhood, died after an ambulance refused to provide her medical service, after she told them that she was living with HIV. At this moment, her body is still in the room. She died drowned and without medical attention,"" they wrote on Twitter.

One report even claims that the paramedics stood on a street corner smoking and drinking while she was suffering.

> After the long wait, Alejandra finally received medical attention. However, this was not encouraging, as she facing not only the respiratory condition but now also discrimination from the paramedics, who, leaving aside their code of ethics, made value judgments about the patient when they knew her HIV positive condition . The attitude they assumed was immediately negative, the witness tells us, and the more time passed, the worse Alejandra's situation got.
>
> There was talk of a possible ""Overdose"", a diagnosis given without evidence, that ""what she presented was going to go down"", that she should calm down and not take anything to eat because she could choke, but at that time she was already drowning.
>
> ""NO, you see her wrong, I'm very scared, please take her to the hospital, my God!"" Diana [Alejandra's friend] begged the first aid personnel, but the only response they received was that she could not be transferred to a Medical Center because she had no symptoms of Covid. The indications they gave her were to be aware that ""this is going to go down"" (referring to the alleged overdose) A diagnosis that cost her her life.
>
> Despite seeing her without air and having taken oxygen in the ambulance, they did nothing more to help her and preferred to go to a corner to drink red wine and smoke a cigarette, showing a callous and inhuman attitude.

Fernanda Antelo,,,,,31-May-2020,tgeu/31-May-2020/Fernanda Antelo,Santa Cruz de la Sierra,Santa Cruz,Bolivia,-17.78369,-63.182104,medical,clinical neglect,"Fernanda was a homeless, HIV+ sex worker who died after 3 days attempting to get medical attention from various health centres who all refused to treat her.

> Fernanda Antelo was the name she used on the streets, a place where many trans people find their livelyhood, who suffer discrimination and lack of decent access to education from their early youth.
>
> She was evicted from the place she was renting and when she was left in the Lazareto center on Tuesday, she remained almost one day waiting for medical attention, according to Muriel Arteaga, the trans activist who tried to help her.
>
> Later, she was taken to her home, with some relatives, by Plan 3,000 and then to the Pueblo Nuevo center. There, they were told that she was putting staff and even those trying to help her at risk.
>
> With an order for the San Juan de Dios hospital, they got into a taxi. In that center, they told her that they could not attend her. It was Friday and they had to return to the relatives' house. On Saturday, exhausted and weak, she died while her friends were looking for someone to attend to her.
>
> This population is culturally and economically vulnerable, explains activist Álvaro Chuvé. His human rights are violated and he considers that he is the most affected of the entire lgbt + community.
>
> Chuvé says she was discriminated against five times: For being a woman, trans, poor, for having an illness and for being a sex worker. Activist Alex Bernabé says an investigation will be requested from the Ombudsman's Office. They hope that this institution manifests itself so that, despite being overwhelmed, the health system serves this population.

Selena Reyes-Hernandez,37,,2020_05_31_Selena-Reyes-Hernandez.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrnFsc5Jvt4,31-May-2020,tgeu/31-May-2020/Selena Reyes-Hernandez,"Marquette Park, Chicago",Illinois,USA,41.7643935,-87.7071772,violence,shot,"Selena was shot by a man who went home with her after she told him that she was transgender. Even though she was dead already, he later returned to shoot her again.

Orlando Perez, 18, was remanded in custody without bail. He is next due to appear in court on 6th July.

> An 18-year-old high school student was allegedly so upset after finding out a woman he went home with was transgender that he killed her.
>
> Even after firing his gun twice at Selena Reyes-Hernandez, Orlando Perez confessed to detectives that he went back to Reyes-Hernandez’s Marquette Park residence a second time so he could shoot her lifeless body again, Cook County prosecutors said Tuesday.
>
> Perez allegedly told detectives during a video-recorded statement that while inside, he asked Reyes-Hernandez if she was a girl. When she said she was trans, he told her he had to leave.
>
> Surveillance cameras show Perez leaving 20 minutes later, and then returning around 6 a.m. with a dark face covering, prosecutors said. The video allegedly shows Perez take out a handgun and rack the slide as he approaches Reyes-Hernandez’s home in the 3300 block of West 71st Street.
>
> Perez was also recorded hopping over the gate to Reyes-Hernandez’s home and then leaving again minutes later, prosecutors said. Perez allegedly told detectives after finding the victim’s door open, he walked in and shot her in the head and back.
>
> “He thought that was enough so he ran out. But he kept seeing her face, so he went back there to do it again,” Assistant State’s Attorney James Murphy said during Perez’s bond hearing.
>
> Perez shot Reyes-Hernandez’s body several more times while she lay face down on the floor, prosecutors said. A witness who heard loud noises later discovered Reyes-Hernandez’s body later that morning.
