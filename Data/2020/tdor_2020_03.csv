According to the advocacy organisation La Rosa Naranja she was killed by an extortion gang.

> Karly Sasha Chinina Palomino, a 33-year-old young trans woman, was killed at dawn on March 5 in Ciudadela, province of Buenos Aires. She was a native of Peru, lived in the City of Buenos Aires and survived by offering sexual services, like many people in the transvestite-transgender group affected by structural violence. 
>
> The San Martín Prosecutor's Office number 5 intervened at the crime scene after the 911 call. Karly's body lay on Avenida Rivadavia and Granaderos, where the avenue runs parallel to the train tracks and there is a level crossing.
>
> The results of the autopsy were not yet known but it is known that she was shot. It is estimated that Karly was murdered between 1 and 2 am on Thursday, March 5, sources from the prosecution reported to Presentes. Some people said they got to see two men running away in the area of the tracks.
>
> Police personnel from the Ciudadela Sur police station intervened in the case. At the time of the incident, the victim carried no documentation so experts were ordered to take fingerprints. However her colleagues said without hesitation that she was Chinina.
>
> The organization La Rosa Naranja [""Orange Rose Civil Association""] released the news through a statement published yesterday on Facebook: “The companion known as Chinina was at the Ciudadela stop with other companions in prostitution, where she was intercepted by a group of criminals, gangsters, square collectors who got out of a car with a firearm and gave 3 shots directly towards our companion, leaving her lying on the ground and lifeless, then escaped. The Trans-Transvestite community is in great pain, sadness, furious because they keep killing us! We ask and demand that all authorities investigate, that Justice be done for Chinina, and that their transvestite not be unpunished.”
>
> Marcela Tobaldi, president of La Rosa Naranja says that Karly's murder is linked “to the mafias of human trafficking suffered by the trans and transvestite collective. They are mafias that force us to the narcotics market and force us to pay places when it shouldn't be. In this case, this girl always refused to pay and ended up with a bullet in the chest.

Patsy was a stylist and an activist with [Pro Trans Chihuahua](https://www.facebook.com/Protransoficial/).

> Kendra Mitchell Vázquez, president of Pro Trans Chihuahua and a close friend of Patsy since her tender teenage days, remembers her cheerful and enterprising. Patsy loved life, used to face the daily pace of days with optimism and hard work, despite the precarious situations in which she could find himself. However, she ended up being a victim of violence and a world that pushes trans women to the narrowest corner of the room.
>
> Patsy had many gifts, such as being a stylist. Her job was her life, to which she printed all the passion that burned in her chest. Always innovating and studying to be the best, to leave a mark and legacy of what I could do, of what it was.
>
> As a warrior, she was a special guest at the Pro Trans Chihuahua association, where she gave a huge piece of her heart trying to watch over and protect her companions, her family.
>
> Her home, like her body, was part of the most valuable thing she had. Never satisfied, she kept building her house, block by block, detail by detail. She was always seen with construction material and in her conversations the great plans that she had for her home surfaced, of which she was increasingly proud. She was very responsible, methodical, inclined to look after her personal image, a lover of good things, beauty products, a joker, vivacious, happy, but a victim of an intolerant and violent society, especially of a Government that does not protect trans women, being murdered on Thursday, March 5, in that palace that she raised especially for a queen like her.
>
> Tears and pain now invade our community, dismayed by a situation that could have been avoided if the correct protection protocols existed for them. But, on the contrary, they live in a reality where they are nothing more than a vulnerable and fragile group, prey to hate crimes not only for those who raise their fists against them, but also of indolent society and a mocking and inhuman press.
>
> Between the crying, Mitchell, on behalf of all, demands justice and promises that it is a crime that will not go unpunished, because the voice will rise and they will go against the cruel leaders and the minds that think them.
>
> No more impunity, no more deaths of trans women, no more fear or vulnerability; We need justice, protection and respect.
>
> Rest in peace, Patsy Andrea Delgado.

He had reportedly had an altercation with a woman earlier in the day.

> A 19-year-old transgender man named Yampi Méndez Arocho was attacked and later shot to death in Cuchillas, a town in the northwestern Puerto Rican municipality of Moca.
>
> While LGBTQ activists in the island nation are now asking the police to investigate the murder as a hate crime, others are upset that both the police and local media reports initially misgendered Arocho.
>
> Police reports state that Arocho had been attacked by a woman five hours before he was later found dead in a local park with four gunshot wounds: two in his face and two through his upper back. Though the woman has since been interviewed by police, when police questioned Arocho’s parents, they allegedly referred to Arocho using his deadname.

> As a result, Arocho was misgendered in initial police and media reports. Members of the local LGBTQ community say that Arocho referred to himself as a man, presented as male, and used “he” pronouns.
>
> Police are still investigating but they say that they haven’t yet figured out a context to help explain why Arocho was murdered. The local LGBTQ organization, the Broad Committee Search for Equity (CABE), are demanding that police “not rule out any angle in their investigation.”

Yampi had reportedly suffered harassment from the woman with who he had been an altercation shortly before his murder.

> The 19-year-old [man] who was murdered on Thursday night in Moca had suffered an alleged pattern of harassment by [a] female with whom [he] had an altercation hours before [his] murder, [his] brother said.

>
> The suspects, identified as 18-year-old Nelvin Nieves and 16-year-old Leonardo Soto Butler, faced charges as adults. Both were brought before Judge Juan Guzmán Escobar, who imposed a bond amounting to $ 190,000.

Her murder is thought to have taken place two days earlier.

> Stephanie Cardona Matías was 32 years old and was found murdered on Tuesday, March 17, by her companions. When they realized that she had not been seen in recent days, they went to her home accompanied by the National Civil Police. According to the National Institute of Forensic Sciences (Inacif), Stephanie's death was caused by multiple knife injuries to the neck. Her murder is presumed to have taken place on March 15.
> 
> Originally from Guatemala City, she lived in the Mixco area, 17 kilometers from the city and was a sex worker in a bar located at calle 7 and avenida 6 in zona 4 of the capital. Sometimes she stayed to sleep there because she had to do double shifts to survive. According to sources close to her, she had received death threats on the Friday prior to her transfemicide.
> 
> ""She was a very polite person, smiling, kind, loving, joking, never angry."" This is how her sister Ingrid remembered her, in dialogue with Presentes. Their mother passed away when they were little. Her brother went to the United States. According to Ingrid, Stephanie was never loved by her father. Since she was little, she sent her to live with her maternal grandmother and when she learned of her transition, she rejected her even more. Stephanie lived with her grandmothers or with her aunt. At 18, when she began her transition, she was forced to leave her family's home, as happens to so many trans [people] in Latin America.

The following is an extract from their obituary, corrected to remove deadnaming and misgendering:

> **[Oliver] Sasser**
>
> March 30, 1998 - March 23, 2020 (age 21)
> 
> Louisville, GA – [Oliver Sasser], 21, loving [child] of [redacted], entered into [their] eternal rest Monday evening, March 23, 2020 at [their] residence. Because of the current ordinances regarding COVID-19 and the family’s respect and concern for public health and safety, the family has chosen to hold private celebration of life services at 2:00 P.M. Sunday afternoon, May 31, 2020 in the James Funeral Home Chapel with Rev. Chris Shoemaker officiating. 
> 
> A lifelong resident of Louisville, [Oliver] was the Salutatorian of the 2016 Jefferson County High School graduating class.  They loved theater and watching movies with [their] family. Having a photographic memory and an inquisitive mind, they loved to read and to learn.  For [them], there was nothing like a good book and/or a good movie.  [Oliver] was all about nature and was an Ecology/Biology major at Augusta University where [they were] scheduled to graduate this year. [Their] passion was animals—all types of animals, even snakes—and the protection of their environment. [They were] very organized, not only in thought but also in [their] physical world—everything had its place. [Oliver] has been described as being “quirky” and having a straight-forward, no-nonsense approach with people and life itself.  This loving [child], devoted [sibling] and loyal friend had a great impact on [their] community and the people [they] met.  [Their] memory will be treasured and honored, and [their] light will continue to shine in the hearts of those [they] has left behind. 

Oliver was an Ecology and Biology major at Augusta University and would have graduated this year. On Thursday 16th April the Augusta University community held a reflection and remembrance of the students, faculty and staff who had passed away over the past year.

According to a friend, Oliver was fine with either he/him or they/them pronouns. Their Facebook profile - https://www.facebook.com/oliver.sasser.3950 - uses the latter so that is what is used in this report.

Both were apprehended after attempting to flee the scene in a car.

> Mexico City.- A [trans woman] was executed with at least one bullet to the head, at calle Estrella casi equina and  Eje 1 Poniente Guerrero in the Guerrero neighborhood, Cuauhtémoc mayor's office. The murderers fled, hitting Paseo de la Reforma, in the roundabout of La Palma in a wine-colored Astra car, where they were detained.
>
> Around 04:30 in the morning on Monday, two armed subjects discussed with a [trans woman], approximately 25 years old, who they then shot in the head before fleeing towards the Paseo de la Reform.
>
> After hearing the gunshots, local residents came out to see what was happening. When they found the a woman lying on the sidewalk they called the 911 emergency number and requested an ambulance to attend to the victim, who was bleeding from the head.

The two killers were arrested after losing control of their vehicle.

> Thanks to surveillance footage, it was possible to identify the agents who were driving a Chevrolet Astra in which they tried to flee. When the driver lost control of the vehicle and crashed in the La Palma roundabout, officers arrested Aristotle Alan, an infantry soldier, and second lieutenant José Luis, both active members of the Sedena.
>
> Both were detained with a weapon loaded with seven 9 mm cartridges and were taken to the CUH-2 ministerial agency.

The circumstances of Naomi's murder illustrate not only how precarious the lives of many trans people are in Latin America, but how many of them are being forced to continue sex work on the street in the midst of the global COVID-19 pandemic:

> “She was looking for her family to love her. To accept her for what she is, ”says Scarlett Vargas Gutiérrez, a trans woman, also a sex worker, who shared a room with the deceased in a downtown hotel between March and September 2019.
>
> Health authorities have been asking people to stay home for weeks because of the pandemic. But there they were, at 4 in the morning, two soldiers and a sex worker.
>
> Scarlett says that the girls live daily, that if they do not go out on the street they do not eat and that in that perspective there is no possible choice.

Lorena had a long history of activism trying to protect trans people - and in particular those who were victims of trafficking, slavery and violence - in New York.

> Borjas, 60, was known as the mother of the trans Latinx community in Queens. As a survivor of human trafficking, she dedicated the past 30 years of her life to protecting other transgender victims of trafficking, slavery and violence.
>
> A large number women she helped were immigrants who were excluded and stigmatised by their families. Borjas was known for hosting them in her own apartment until they were able to support themselves.
>
> She spent years walking the streets and supporting others to escape abusive situations, providing condoms and food, connecting trans women to services and support, and even set up a weekly HIV testing clinic in her own home.
