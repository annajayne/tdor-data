After her death other staff walked out, citing inadequate safety protocols.

Managers had refused to allow her to take time off sick and blamed ""hormone injections"" for her illness.

> An employee of a local restaurant has died after exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms and coworkers have filed a complaint with state and county regulators over safety protocols at the location.
>
> Employees at the Santa Monica Burger King, located on the 1900 block of Pico Blvd., say Angela Martinez Gómez died on July 6 and that managers let her come to work while she exhibited symptoms consistent with COVID-19.
>
> “Several workers walked out for safety on July 6, after learning of Angela’s death,” said a complaint filed with CAL/OSHA and the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health. “A worker shouldn’t have to die and workers shouldn’t have to strike to call attention to COVID-19 safety at Burger King.”
>
> According to the complaint, Martinez worked sick for a full week before leaving her shift early on June 29. The complaint states she was coughing, nauseous and taking frequent bathroom breaks. It states she was self-medicating with cold medicine and that employees learned she had died on July 6.
>
> The complaint said a second employee also worked during the same time while exhibiting chills and a high temperature.
>
> Yolanda Garcia filed the complaint and said she is the third employee to develop symptoms.
>
> “I feel very worried and I have a bad headache,” she wrote. “July 8 I woke up coughing with chills, shaking and body aches, my right lung hurts making it difficult to breathe, and I am very tired. I am worried about my health and my family’s health; eight of us live together, and my brother and I both have diabetes. Last week I visited my grandchildren, and now I do not know if I have COVID-19, or if I gave it to them. I am worried.”
>
> Garcia said she told the manager about her concerns but was told Martinez’s death was a result of medical treatment, not COVID-19 as Gomez was transgender and taking hormones.
>
> “I don’t know of anyone who has been notified as a close contact or quarantined” said Garcia. “I told (the manager) I was going to get tested for COVID-19, and she said she was going to get tested too, but she also said she didn’t think Angela died of COVID-19, she said Angela died of injecting hormones. That doesn’t make sense to me.”
>
> In her complaint, Garcia alleges the restaurant has not provided fresh masks for each shift, does not implement physical distancing requirements in the kitchen, has not trained staff on safety protocols and doesn’t clean frequently enough.

> Marilyn Cazares, 22, was found dead in an abandoned building as first responders answered a fire call in the early hours of Monday morning. In the wake of what was described as a “horrific” and “hateful” killing, news reports and Cazares’s family have continued to use the name and pronouns by which she was assigned at birth. Police are investigating the incident as a homicide, although they currently have very little information about the circumstances.
>
> According to the local news outlet KYMA-13, which misgenders her in their reporting, Cazares experienced homelessness and lived in the building where she was apparently murdered. Cazares’s aunt, Mindy Garcia, said she was loved for her charisma, describing her as brave, outspoken, and a very beautiful person.
>
> Cazares could be seen walking “down Main Street all the time looking beautiful with her head held up high,” Garcia said. “That’s how she should be remembered.”

Subsequently, a 42 year old businessman was arrested for her murder.

> Killed with at least 80 stabs last Monday, 20, the transsexual artist from Ceará, Manuela de Cássia, was close to leaving the escorting profession and returning to Fortaleza. The information was revealed by a friend of the victim in an interview with O POVO CBN radio. The crime occurred in [maps in Milan,] Italy, and was committed by a client after an argument.
> 
> Receptionist Antonio Teixeira Neto, a longtime friend of Manuela's, revealed that she was looking to profit by investing in the real estate sector in order to be able to build a beauty salon in Fortaleza and return to the city as a hairdresser, in which she had technical training and experience, according to the friend.
> 
> “Someone determined and generous”, as Antonio defined Manuela. He points out that she tried to help everyone around her, especially her family. She also said that she maintained regular contact with her friend, using voice and video calls, especially during the coronavirus quarantine.
> 
> Asked if Manuela reported any fear or commented on any kind of threat, the receptionist said that there was no unusual report in his last conversations with her. “But with time, the risks become less perceptible. [Being an escort] is a long shot, ”he said. Antonio mentioned that violence is routine in a companion's life and that, over time, people become less sensitive to any dangerous situation.

Four days after the murder Cristian Losso, 42, was arrested. On 25th January 2021 his trial started on charges of voluntary homicide aggravated by cruelty and torture.

> The 42-year-old bank employee, arrested four days after the crime, was identified from images taken by security cameras in the area: on the day when Rabacchi's body was discovered, according to the videos, he entered twice in short distance in the building where the victim lived.
>
> According to the investigative hypothesis, Losso committed the murder after an evening of alcohol and drugs and then returned to the apartment to eliminate the evidence by starting fires on the kitchen counter in an attempt to cause an explosion. For this last aspect, the man must also answer for the charge of collapse of buildings or other malicious disasters and not of massacre as claimed by the investigators at first.
>
> In the first hearing, the bank's lawyer, Davide Montani, will file documentation on Losso's mental state in view of a request to the Court of Appraisal to assess whether the accused was capable of understanding and willing at the time of the events.

On 24th May 2021 Losso was sentenced to 18 years in prison for Manuela's murder.

> MILAN, MAY 24 (ANSA) - A Milan court on Monday sentenced former Italian banker Cristian Losso to 18 years in prison for the murder of Manuela, a Brazilian trans woman, with 147 stab wounds. The crime took place on July 20, 2020 in the capital of the Lombardy region.

Shortly before, on board her Citroen, she had hit her friend's body, then in shock she stopped to rescue her. But there was nothing more for the victim to do.

Steffany's social identity was determined as a result of reports by [Observatório Trans](https://observatoriotrans.org/assassinatos-2020) & [PGM](https://www.facebook.com/groups/pgmreal/permalink/4121203401286263/). Her Facebook profile is https://www.facebook.com/steffanydior/.

> ""It was suicide."" This is how the Police described the death of a trans woman whose body was found at her home, early Wednesday morning, in a neighborhood of the municipality of Soledad, Atlántico. Few details came to light about what happened.
> 
> In fact, according to neighbors, the investigators ""did not take long"" at the crime scene, nor, in their opinion, did they gather enough evidence to corroborate or discard the initial hypothesis.
> 
> Gabriela, as the trans woman was known, was a 29-year-old Venezuelan migrant, resident in the country for 4 years and working as a hairdresser. ""It was little talk"" and ""she didn't mess with anyone,"" according to her friends and neighbors.
> 
> The investigators, according to Gabriela's colleagues, ""did not show great interest in knowing who she was, and much less in investigating why she had allegedly taken her life,"" but they assured that their friend ""had had an argument with a person the day before her death and, after the fight had passed, she left her house quite neat and elegant. ""
> 
> Gabriela's case, according to organizations that defend the rights of LGBT people, has elements that cannot be dismissed and, on the contrary, must be taken into account, because in criminal policy, suicides can be induced or motivated. That is why, they highlight, the investigation ""is essential in this type of events"", as well as the search for the appropriate evidentiary material to verify or rule out the prejudicial motive of a fact, so that the victims can obtain better access to justice in their cases.
