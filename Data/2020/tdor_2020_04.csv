Four months later, police finally started to investigate her death.

> Police are finally investigating the death of a Black trans woman who was found dead in the street more than four months ago with horrifying injuries and cremated without an autopsy.
> 
> Chef Ashley Moore was just 26 years old when she was found dead outside the YMCA in Newark, New Jersey, just after 4 am on April 1.
> 
> Her mother, nurse Starlet Carbin, was never notified by police that her daughter had passed away. Instead, she had to find out via Facebook when she visited her daughter’s profile to wish her a happy birthday, nine days after she had died.
> 
> Interviewed by activist Jasmin Singer, Carbin said: “All the information I obtained I got on my own. No one contacted me to let me know my child was dead.”
> 
> When Carbin contacted authorities, she was first told by a Newark police detective that a doctor at the hospital Moore was transported to before she was pronounced dead said she had likely been hit by a car. Later, the same detective suggested she could have fallen from a great height.
> 
> Carbin said the police report, which she was allowed to finally access at the end of July, noted that there were ligature marks on Moore’s legs, she had suffered rectal bleeding and her neck was “grossly swollen and disfigured”.
> 
> As a trained nurse, Carbin said: “Going into what I know when I’m looking at a patient, the description that’s in that police report is not of someone who fell or was hit by a vehicle.”
> 
> The police report also states that a witness saw Moore running down, not up, the stairs of the YMCA before she was found outside.

> A 26-year-old [trans] girl was murdered in a cruel way in the early hours of this Saturday (4) in Querência (970 km from Cuiabá).
>
> Rayka França, 26, had her face disfigured by stones. She was found at around 1:30 am by residents of the Setor F neighborhood in Querência, who heard noises and, upon leaving the house, saw a tall man with a cap and a black backpack walking alone. They went to the place where the noise had come from and, with the aid of a cell phone light, saw, a person breathing hard in the undergrowth.
>
> A Military Police team went to the scene and found her with several injuries on the front and side of her face, but still alive. Residents said they did not see the crime, but heard it, and showed the police where the victim was. At the scene, the military also found some stones with bloodstains, which had possibly been used to cause the victim's injuries.
>
> An emergency team from the Municipal Hospital was called, performed first aid and took the victim to the hospital. Upon arriving at the unit, however the [trans woman] suffered a respiratory arrest and died.

Subsequently two men were arrested and partially confessed to her murder, but were released through lack of evidence.

> According to police chief Michael Mendes Paes, the information provided by one of the defendants, who partially confessed to the crime and attributed complete responsibility to the other, was not compatible with other data obtained during investigative work.
>
> After being interviewed, the two suspects were released because there was no well-founded suspicion that they were the perpetrators of the crime. Investigations are ongoing to identify and arrest the perpetrator of the murder, as well as to clarify the real motive for the crime.

her brother Arturo had this to say about her in an [interview](https://www.homosensual.com/lgbt/trans/mi-hermana-ana-karen-era-una-mujer-trans-y-su-asesinato-continua-impune/) in November 2020:

""I considered her a sister, not by blood, but by choice, since our relationship was one of [siblings]. I never had that relationship with my primary family, but with Karen I did and she will always be my sister. Her partner, some friends and I lived together and there was a very relaxed atmosphere. She was a very practical problem solver and was my advisor. He said “you have to smile and always keep going”"".

Most of their birth family had rejected both Ana and Arturo - in her case because she was trans, and in his case because he was dating a trans woman.

> Civil and military police officers in the city of Cumaru do Norte, in southern Pará, face difficulties in investigating the case of a murder in the mining area known as Maria Bonita, in the municipality of Cumaru do Norte. Because civil and military police do not operate within indigenous lands, they are not allowed to enter the mine to collect the body, make arrests or investigate the crime.

> According to information raised by the report, the victim was the [trans woman] whose identity the police are [withholding], but it is known that he answered by the [social name] of Letícia, 18 years old. She was shot after a quarrel with a woman identified as Cíntia Raiana do Nascimento, who was at the bar where the crime occurred. The projectile hit the mouth of the victim who died on the spot.
> 
> According to information that reached the newsroom, the place where the bars operate works as a kind of ""Cabaret"" - a term used by the prospectors for a brothel and place for romantic encounters in the mining area.
> 
> As the mining area is located within a Kaiapó indigenous reserve, the Military and Civil Police are not allowed to enter the area to carry out the post-mortem survey or investigate the crime. Only Federal Police agents can enter the area.

She was struggling with depression and loneliness, and had been rejected by half of the members of her family.

A friend contributed the following quote about her:

> She was an amazing friend. She was so considerate, perceptive and thoughtful, she would reach out to me to offer help before I even realized I needed it. Others in our community have described her as a kind and gentle spirit with an amazingly big heart. One remembered her as the first person they came out to. She would take other girls shopping when they were first coming out and afraid to shop in the women's section on their own. She lived to help others.
>
> All of her social media was deleted shortly after she passed, but her blog is still up. Here is a link but be advised she discusses depression and suicidal ideation in detail in some posts - https://emilythetransgirl.wordpress.com/


Emily had come out on 20th October 2018 but unfortunately the response from far too many was not at all positive.

> October 20th 2018
> 
> I came out to everyone on Facebook
> 
> I lost half of my family. My mom (step mom who raised me and means a lot to me now) is the one, along with a couple friends, who saved me.
>
> The family that I lost was saying nasty things to me. I was told that I was praying wrong. I was told to stop worshipping the devil and that everyone who accepts me also worships the devil. Things like “it’s just a phase.” Or “you are messing up your life.” were said to me.
>
> Believe me, I thought long and hard about coming out. I never wanted to transition. However, when I was ready to cut off the dick just to die without a dick between my legs, I knew that I couldn’t stop. It hurt so bad having it between my legs. It freaking hurt. I had a physical pain that would never go away. Usually ibuprofen would help. However, it was the most uncomfortable feeling that I have had. I didn’t want to keep it. 
>
> My mom suggested for me to just block them and have no contact. It hurts, but thanks to living in the south, religion is a different story. My friend, Margot in a northern state is very supportive and actually shocked that my family acted that way towards me.

At least Emily's obituary remembers her respectfully:

> ""She dreamed pretty dreams that never came true."" Emily Nicole Brown found peace from her battles on April 20, 2020. We will miss her gentle, kind spirit. She is remembered by her parents, Jeff and Jennifer, her siblings, Jasper, Abigail, and Adwyn, all of Covington; her grandparents Cyndy Lifsey of Augusta and Roy and Merita Brown of Douglasville, as well as numerous uncles, aunts, and cousins. A celebration of life will be held at a future date. Contributions to a memorial garden can be sent to her parents at [redacted], or a donation can be made in her memory to https://www.thetrevorproject.org.


***Editor's note:** In addition to rejection and abuse from some members of her family, Emily had experienced similar behaviour from colleagues at work. Emily seemed like a person with so much potential and I can't help wondering if she would still be with us had she had been nurtured and supported in the way all newly out trans people need and deserve. Just when will society stop killing vulnerable trans people?*
