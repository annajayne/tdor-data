> In the early hours of Saturday, Roberta, a Peruvian trans woman, was killed with four stabs at the corner of calle 1 and 62 in La Plata, province of Buenos Aires, a location where [sex workers] operate. Roberta was 45 years old [some accounts say 50] and a survivor of a group whose life expectancy is 35. After the attack her companions took her to San Martin Hospital, where she died hours later.

Footage from security cameras in the area has already been requested and a white Chevrolet Corsa vehicle identified at the site. According to witnesses consulted by the Sudaka agency, two men were hanging around and bothering the girls and asking about Roberta.

> OTRANS Argentina are calling for a mobilization for this Monday, February 3 at 11:30 a.m. at calles 1 and 62. Claudia Vásquez Haro, president of the organization said:
>
> “We have been denouncing systematically how transsexuals and transvestites are annihilated for not be a possible destination, for a sector of society. We need concrete public policies to reverse this type of violence that end the lives of trans partners. At the same time, we want to be entitled to grief; because when any citizen dies, society gets sick, everyone feels sorry, feels sorry, gets upset. However, we still have not been able to be as Marlene Wayar and Susy Shock says on the emotional agenda of our country. We need society to fight for our deaths too.”

She had been strangled inside a motel nearby.

> A transgender woman was murdered at a motel in Campeche, Florianópolis. Samantha do Valle, 20, was killed by a client after a program inside the establishment in the south of the island.
>
> The homicide occurred on February 6, but news was only released this Friday (21), after the director of the Civil Police in Greater Florianópolis, Eliane Chaves, commented on the case.
>
> A friend of Samantha who lives in São Paulo reported the disappearance of the young woman to the police. The family did not learn of her death until four days after her body was located.
>
> The Civil Police was called. According to Eliane, the man was arrested in the act and said only that he was Samantha's client. The case is treated as femicide.
>
> “Apparently, she was [doing sex work]. He [the killer] did not give a reason for the death. He was silent,” said the director.

Samantha was from Paraná and had transitioned in adolescence. Her family were supportive.

> An uncle of Samantha, who asked not to have her name revealed, said the young woman had her social name on her identity documents, but her death certificate showed the wrong gender. The family plans to go to court to modify the document that attested to the girl's death.
>
> “I will go to court to change the name [in the document]. If she has a social name, it had to be in the documents. It's the law. It will not bring Samanta's life back, but we want to prevent other trans women and other human beings from being victims of these brutal cases,” said the man.
>
> Born in Paraná, Samantha spent her adolescence in São Paulo. According to the young woman's uncle, it was during this period that Samantha assumed her social name and began to plan for the future. Her desire was to take an eyebrow designer course or travel abroad.
>
> In an interview with nd + this Friday morning (21), the friend of the young woman spoke to her. According to them, Samantha was a quiet person and close to the family. They had known each other for about two years.
>
> On social networks, friends and family left messages for the young woman. “Evil has reached you, just you who had no evil. I will always remember you, in your sweet way,” said a family member.

> The victim's brother-in-law, Lucas Magalhães said that before dying Katarina managed to fulfill part of her dream of helping the family, by renovating her mother's house. The sales supervisor also said it was inconceivable that cases like this continue to happen, mentioning [trans woman] Monike Matias Chagas, 25, found dead in the municipality of Missão Velha in the south of Ceará yesterday morning.
>
> “She [Katerina] was mean to no-one. She came to São Paulo to make her dreams come true, to give her mother a better life. She even got part of that dream, which was to renovate part of her mother's house.
>
> [Her death] was very painful. Everyone who knows Katarina knows that she is a docile person, a kind person, both here and there. The family is very shaken and we just ask for justice. Let the person who did this spend the rest of his life in jail. We want it to stop, that is not just another case. Yesterday, another one happened, which is Monike, and we want this not to happen anymore, not just another number.”

>
> Patel added that Nadia and Mamta had been living together for some time. “They were in love and Nadia had also tattooed the Mamta’s name on his forearm. However, after some time Mamta came to know that Nadia is also in love with a woman. This triggered frequent fights between Nadia and Mamta,” Patel said.
> 
> Police officials said during interrogation it came to light that Nadia used to take money from Mamta and spend it to woo the woman. This enraged Mamta.
>
> “On Tuesday night Mamta had a fight with Nadia on the same issue. Nadia lost his temper and stabbed Mamta several times, killing Mamta on the spot. We have sent the body for postmortem,” Patel said.

Early indications are that she died several weeks earlier.

> Around 10 am on Saturday 15 February, a decaying body was found by the traffic police on the banks of the Tiber, in an uninhabited and degraded area in the Villa Spada area of Rome. According to the coroner, who hypothesized that it is the body of a trans woman, the death dates back to about a month ago.
>
> The corpse was hidden by a mattress which, together with the unusual place of discovery, suggests that it is a murder with subsequent concealment. The track of the murder is in fact followed by the men of the police, who wait for the results of the autopsy to have more information on the cause of death.
>
> Less than a month ago, [another trans woman had been found dead inside her home in Frosinone](https://tdor.translivesmatter.info/reports/2020/01/16/name-unknown_frosinone-lazio-italy_4fd5e775): even in that case, police intervention was needed to investigate the dynamics of the death. The numbers of trans people killed every year in the world are alarming; Transrespect versus Transphobia Worldwide (TvT) presents every year, on the occasion of the TDoR, a report with the count of all cases recorded in the last year: in 2019 331 trans people were killed in the world, with Italy at the top in Europe.

> The location where the discovery took place is frequented by stragglers, prostitutes, transsexuals and couples looking for intimacy and transgression away from prying eyes. Nor is it possible to exclude the track of murder by a maniac. In April last year the mutilated body of another [LGBT+ person] was found in via Franco Angeli in the Prenestino district, while in June in Trigoria the charred body of a trans [person] was found.

**Note:** Observatorio Trans record in their data that the victim *may* be  [Lara Argento](https://primapavia.it/cronaca/ritrovato-cadavere-a-roma-vicino-al-tevere-e-forse-lara/), who has been missing since 21st December 2019:

> 22 - Lara Argento, Brazilian, Roma (Italy), 02/18/2020
>
> Lara Argento's searches lead to Rome, because after the great mobilization of forces and the maxi operation carried out on Monday morning, February 10, in Canarazzo, a body was found on Saturday morning in Rome, near the Tiber. A body in an advanced state of decomposition that, however, could be that of Lara, the Brazilian escort who disappeared from Pavia on December 21 last year.

Consequentially the TGEU TDoR 2020 list names her accordingly, but in fact (see https://www.ilgiorno.it/pavia/cronaca/trans-scomparsa-1.5124653) it appears that a DNA examination has ruled this out.

> On February 15 the lifeless body of a transsexual [woman] was found in Rome: the comparison of DNA excluded a correspondence since immediately considered unlikely.

I can't believe I'm writing these words at all. Because you're supposed to be here, Camila. You were supposed to be there Thursday and you weren't. And I texted you because I was worried. Because you were missing. A big part of this dream was missing and i should have known... I should have listened to that voice inside that said something was wrong... My love, you were brilliant. You were powerful. You were a creator Marvin and I were ready to champion to the ends of the earth. The first time you sat in that room with us a year and a half ago you were magnetic. You told story like you were spinning cotton candy. The sweetness enveloping the jagged edges of a woman looking to heal. My girl from El Monte who went to Yale who loved her girl from Norwalk who went to Stanford. And we trauma-bonded over being the only ones in a sea of whiteness. Over leaving our hoods and doing better and doing right by our mamis. You were an angel God sent me. I'll never forget the first text you sent me filled with so much love, respect, and adoration. You said you looked up to me but in words that felt like they were coming from the universe itself because you always seemed to send them when I needed them most. When I was struggling with making the show and was having a hard time believing in myself. You were this angel that would pop into my messages or into my office and say exactly what I needed to hear... and did I ever thank you for that? I thought I did but now I can't remember. And fuck I hope I did. You were a light. A brilliant light that struggled to shine in the midst of the darkness in this world. But I saw you, girl. I fucking saw you from the moment I laid eyes on you. I knew you were fucking magic and I wanted the world to devour your magnificence the way you deserved. Baby, you were going to have a show on HBO. I needed that show. I needed your voice. Your story. Your wisdom. Your fucking fierce wit and fearless IDGAF fervor. You should be here.</a></p> <p style="" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;"">A post shared by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/lindayvettechavez/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading"" style="" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;"" target=""_blank""> Linda Yvette Chávez</a> (@lindayvettechavez) on <time style="" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;"" datetime=""2020-02-23T07:08:03+00:00"">Feb 22, 2020 at 11:08pm PST</time></p></div></blockquote>

In August 2018 [Vanessa Campos](https://tdor.translivesmatter.info/reports/2018/08/17/vanessa-campos_bois-de-boulogne-paris-france_ebdadf72) had been killed nearby.

> A transgender [sex worker] from the Bois de Boulogne was crushed on the night of Thursday to Friday in Paris. Around 2:25 a.m. on allée de la reine Marguerite, a car with three suspects on board ran into the victim, who has not yet been formally identified. According to initial reports, the manoeuvre was deliberate.
>
> The emergency services were alerted by two witnesses. When briefly questioned, they said that a Renault Clio with no lights had driven at high speed towards the victim (who was on the road) and then driven away without stopping.
>
> The victim died at around 2:40 am in the hands of the emergency services and her body was taken to the medico-legal institute in Paris. Investigators from the first judicial police district are responsible for carrying out an investigation.
>
> The police discovered some debris from the killer car. At the end of the night, a Clio which could correspond to the description given by the witnesses was found abandoned in the XXth arrondissement of Paris.

After Jessyca's murder Acceptess Transgenres released the following [statement](https://www.facebook.com/acceptess.transgenres/?eid=ARAcF3LT6DPoRb_XjZCXc7bIPn-akNED5XkW2lYOE5M2eO1euCL5WX-X5JFWFjQrCVKe3J7s9hfNxzWg):

> **Death of Jessyca Sarmiento**
> **ACCEPTESS TRANSGENRES · FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 21, 2020**
>
> We are once again in the sadness of the discovery of the death of one of our own. On the night of February 20-21, Jessyca Sarmiento was killed at her workplace, knocked down by a car traveling at high speed in an alley in the Bois de Boulogne. The first elements of the investigation communicated by the press indicate that the car which struck it did not even stop. We are particularly dismayed by the possibility that this act was deliberate. An investigation has been opened and must shed light on the circumstances of this new tragedy. But it also calls for a response from the political class.
>
> Today, as it was two years ago after the assassination of Vanessa Campos, we are once again shocked by the death of one of our sisters, comrades, and colleagues. Our pain and suffering are indescribable. And our anger too. We know that we are going to have to fight against the enterprise of media trivialization already at work, in Le Parisien , whose first publication announced as usual the death of “a transvestite prostitute”, in a “high place of male prostitution”. Jessyca was a trans woman, sex worker, migrant, and she was killed at her workplace. We are dismayed to notice that the first reflex of the press is still, to stigmatize.
>
> In France, in 2020, it is still possible to think that assaulting trans people, assaulting sex workers are acts that can leave their perpetrators with a certain feeling of impunity, even pride, because they leave to their spectators a feeling of indifference, even of approval. We immerse ourselves in horror, in sadness, and in the constantly renewed bitter observation that our lives are worth so much less than those of others.
>
> Jessyca was a trans Peruvian woman, who came to France last year and, like all of us, aspired to a better life in this country. She had been followed for the first time by an abolitionist prostitution association, which had failed to ensure her care. She then turned to Acceptess-T. She benefited in our association from social, legal, health and administrative support, but she also found there a place of refuge and mutual aid, emotional and human support. Last month, she had started to participate in our French lessons, she was studious, applied, and generous, bringing to each session the meal for her comrades. She was “the driving force behind the group,” according to her teacher. She was preparing for the association's monthly celebration, scheduled for February 28. She had come to France to work and live there. She worked there and lived there for a year. And we cannot bear the idea that she died there for these reasons.
>
> We are already in contact with her family in Peru, and we are making the necessary arrangements so that they can come quickly to Paris. We are organizing a vigil this evening at 11 p.m. at the Bois de Boulogne. We call on our loved ones, our comrades, our colleagues and all those who can and who think that our lives deserve so much better, to join us at this gathering.

Isabelle died at the scene.

> The second victim of the attack that left a transsexual woman dead in the Ingleses neighborhood, in Florianópolis, had her death confirmed this Saturday (22). Bruna Andrade, 30, has been admitted to the hospital since she was stabbed when she was with [Isabelle Colstt](https://tdor.translivesmatter.info/reports/2020/02/04/isabelle-colstt_florianopolis-santa-catarina-brazil_461f4f77), just over two weeks ago.

Bruna went be the name Onlynabru within the Pokemon GO community. Shortly after her death other players organised a tribute for her.

> Bruna died last month of transphobia. She was a very well liked person in the Pokémon Go player community, so the Community is getting together to paint graffiti in her honor, turning them into pokestops / gyms to eternalize her memory in the game she loved so much! Some graffiti artists have already volunteered and embraced the cause, so we are organizing a kitty to buy the materials (the labor will be donated by them). Any help is welcome! Thanks in advance for everyone's help!

In March 2021 it was reported that a suspect is going to trial for Bruna's femicide. A trial date has not yet been set.

> The man suspected of killing a trans woman in a motel in Florianópolis is going to a popular jury trial for femicide, after a complaint by the Public Ministry of Santa Catarina (MPSC). The [trans woman] was found dead inside the trunk of a car in Campeche, south of Santa Catarina Island, in Florianópolis, in February 2020. 
>
> According to the police, the man had an intimate relationship with the victim, but despised her because of [she was transgender]. On February 6, he allegedly took the victim to the motel on the pretext of having an intimate date. There, he allegedly asphyxiated her to death.
>
> According to the police, the man then hid the body in the trunk of the car and tried to leave the scene without raising suspicions, but was intercepted by the police and arrested in the act.

In addition to it, the body of a man identified as Paulo Ricardo Cardoso Carvalho, 45, born in Encruzilhada, was also located at the same location and under the same conditions.
>
> As the two bodies were in an advanced state of decomposition, it was not initially possible to identify the cause of the deaths. The corpses were collected and sent for necropsy. The two deaths are treated by the police as homicide and feminicide, as Maria Eduarda had recently changed her name and gender in her identification documents.
>
> The General Institute of Forensics should forward a report to the Civil Police in the next few days with the first notes of technical evidence collected at the crime scene. The police are also expected to start collecting the first eight witnesses this week as part of the investigation launched to investigate the murders.

Police believe that they had been killed elsewhere. The date and cause of their deaths is not known.

> As the bodies were in an advanced state of decomposition, it was not possible to find out what caused the deaths. According to the delegate, the hypothesis is that they were murdered in another location.

> “She was a woman. She was called Alexa,” he said.

> **Who was Alexa?**
>
> According to information compiled by the CABE, Alexa was born in 1991 in the municipality of Carolinas, near San Juan, in a poor and dysfunctional family.
>
> ""Apparently, she was the type of trans person who is expelled from the family or who has suffered violence, including sexual, within the family,"" says Pagan.

> After her murder, several people who met her told on social networks that they had seen her walk through several municipalities of Puerto Rico.

> ""She was a homeless person who had mental health conditions and wandered around different areas. Here it is necessary to explain that being transgender is not a mental health condition, although there are transgender people, as it seems to be this case, that given the violence they have suffered may suffer mental conditions"".


On 6th August 2021 three suspects were arrested by the FBI:

> The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) arrested this morning three men identified as  Jordany Laboy García, Christian Yamaurie Rivera Otero and Anthony Steven Lobos Ruiz, linked to the death of the transgender woman Alexa.
>
> The subjects were indicted by a federal grand jury and appeared today at the initial hearing before a magistrate where they face three charges: conspiracy to commit hate crime, violation of the Hate Crimes Prevention Act and obstruction of justice.
