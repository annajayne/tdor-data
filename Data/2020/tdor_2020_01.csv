>
> McAlester police are investigating after a man was found fatally shot inside a taxi early Wednesday.

> ""Dustin was such an amazing and special person. He was incredibly generous, kind, intelligent, and so empathetic. He had so many things that he wanted to do and achieve in his life. He was everyone’s shoulder to cry on and the best listener. He wanted to help everyone. Everyone always talks about his brilliant, contagious smile and positive attitude that brightened the room, no matter the surroundings.
>
> I have always known how special he was, but I had no idea of all the lives that he touched and I am so grateful for all the love and support I have received.

She volunteered with Montgomery Pride and worshipped with the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Montgomery.

In death her family misgendered and deadnamed her.

The following notice was published by her faith community:

> Emerald M. Kelliher, 31, a resident of Montgomery, AL, passed away on Friday, January 3rd, 2020. Emerald was born on September 25, 1988 in Enterprise, Alabama. She is survived by her father, Dr. John C. Kelliher and her mother, Anne C. Kelliher. She is also survived by her brother, Phillip Kelliher (Glenda), her sisters, Susan Kelliher, Margot Whatley and Amber Rice (Brandon). She is also survived by numerous nieces and nephews as well as other extended family members. Emerald was preceded in death by her grandparents and her sister, Bridget Mary Kelliher.
>
> Emerald graduated from Loveless Academic Magnet Program in May of 2007. Upon graduation, she was awarded a Congressional German Scholarship. Emerald had a deep love for animals including her beloved companion, Zorro. She also worked, for a period time, with her dad, at his veterinary clinic.  
>  
> The family is having a private burial service on Monday, January 6th. A memorial service for friends and family will be held on Tuesday, January 7th, at 5:00pm at First Assembly of God in the Jones Chapel, located at 135 Bell Rd, Montgomery, AL.

>  
> — Adapted from the funeral home notice in which she was misgendered and deadnamed by her family, and which can be seen here: https://www.turnersfuneralhome.net/obituary/michael-kelliher.

Her friend and pastor Rev. Lynn Hopkins of the [Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Montgomery](http://uumontgomery.org/) wrote the following tribute to her:

> Emerald was a cherished member of the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Montgomery, and of the community service coalition Montgomery Pride United. She was known as someone who would always step up when someone was in need, even if there was nothing she could do. She had nothing, but she shared everything without reservation. She never sought to disturb or disrupt, but her truth telling often cause disruption and she bore the cost of it. She would not bend or compromise to suit others, and took the hot glares of society and her own family rather than diminish her own truth.  
>  
> Emerald was an avid singer, a tireless volunteer, a skilled debater, a vibrant actor, and a lover of animals of all types. She struggled with bipolar depression for many years, and though she continued to seek treatment and took her meds, she could never find lasting relief. After the death of her beloved companion dog Zorro in 2019, she began a downward spiral from which she could not recover. Finally unable to see any hope of relief from the crushing pain and relentless isolation in her illness, she ended her own life alone at the Zorro's gravesite.



[Montgomery Pride](https://montgomeryprideunited.org/news/mpu-planning-meeting) also mourned her passing:

> The first known and reported suicide of a transgender person in the U.S. in 2020 occurred Friday, January 3 in Montgomery, Alabama.  
>  
> Less than one year after the murder of Dana Martin - the first reported transgender victim of murder in the U.S. in 2019 - occurred in Montgomery, the LGBTQ community is once again mourning the death of a transgender person.  
>  
> Emerald Kelliher - 31 years of age - died Friday, January 3. Emerald had many friends in the LGBTQ+ community in Montgomery, and was well known and loved especially by the transgender and gender-nonconforming community.  
>  
> She is described by her friends as being bubbly, and a great conversationalist. She was also an activist, a daughter, a lover of animals, a beacon of light and a bright jewel, and someone who dearly loved her friends.  
>  
> Those that knew Emerald knew that besides being so delightfully different and gender non-conforming and could absolutely rock that little black dress and her floppy hats, knew also that she suffered from mental illness. She had many friends who would sit with her for hours while she poured out her heart. She tried in many different ways to find the root of her depression and frustration. She was desperate for peace.  
>  
> Emerald will be honored and mourned at a Grief and Loss Support Group hosted by Montgomery PRIDE United Monday evening, January 6th at the Bayard Rustin Community Center located at 635 Madison Ave. in downtown Montgomery and in a memorial service January 11th at 7 PM at the Unitarian Universalists Fellowship 2810 Atlanta Hwy, Montgomery, Alabama 36109.

Finally, this closing quote from the Esquire article [*In Alabama, Pride Is a Protest for Queer Survival—Even If That Means Protesting Alone*](https://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/a32712313/pride-2020-montgomery-alabama-quarantine-protest) seems so poignant - not just for Emerald, but for all of the trans folks we lose to suicide:

> **So, perhaps Emerald is not gone. Emerald comes along for walks in the park. She lingers in Zoom calls. She exists in the protests that will happen in individual homes across Montgomery and beyond. And now, I suppose she’s with you, too.**

> McCray, who was identified female at birth but identified as a male, filed a complaint with the Illinois Department of Human Rights in October 2015 over equal access to the gender-appropriate bathroom and locker rooms at the high school. The then-senior enlisted the help of the American Civil Liberties Union in Chicago to reach a settlement with the school allowing him and other students to use facilities that match their gender.

>
> McCray told The State Journal-Register in 2016 that he was assigned a female identity at birth but transitioned to male his sophomore year in high school.
>
> He said he initially went along with the high school’s decision that he use a separate bathroom because he felt more comfortable. But as he got older and more mature, he decided he wanted to use the boy’s bathroom because that was what he used in other public places.
>
> McCray eventually protested and refused to use the designated bathroom, saying it stigmatized him. That’s also when he decided to file the complaint to force a change, he said.

> It has happened again. Again and it should be the last. Once again our voices break from the depths of our being. Today we are invaded again by helplessness, pain and misunderstanding in the face of such subtle hatred. From Chrysallis we claim the right of all trans people to a life free of violence.  It is not suicide, it is social murder caused by transphobia.
>
> There are many types of transphobia, there is one that is exercised behind the curtain, which is sneaked, throwing the stone and hiding the hand. There is one that does not even seem transphobic because it hides behind a facade of false understanding and acceptance. This transphobia is also hate and kill.
>
> All people deserve the same opportunities, opportunities to study, work, to fall in love and fall out of love. Build illusions and carry them out, or not, but keep that illusion as a possibility that can happen to us, that can accompany us, that can make us happy. If these illusions encounter obstacles despite having family support and accompaniment, they can vanish and give way to despair.
>
> We never tire of repeating again and again that transphobia kills.
>
> We denounce this society, saturated with conventions, stereotypes and absurd beliefs that reproduce in an endless cycle and must cease. We demand an end to all types of hatred and violence, including that under cover of goodism. We invite reflection, to all those people who, hidden by the intimacy of what is cooked in the kitchens of their homes, think innocent and exculpate and lament in the distance and behind the walls.
>
> We claim protection. We families alone cannot. A society with public and legal structures that guarantee a happy and full life in rights for trans people is essential.
>
> Once again from Chrysallis we shout:  **IT IS NOT SUICIDE, IT IS SOCIAL MURDER!**

A body was found in July, but has not yet been positively identified.

> A body found on the side of a road in Santo Antônio de Leverger, 35 km from Cuiabá, which could belong to Mari de Bastos Lima, 37, has not yet been identified and buried. It turns out that DNA testing cannot be performed because Mari's family who lives in Maranhão cannot afford to travel to Mato Grosso to give samples of genetic material.
>
> The Civil Police reported that the identification of the bones found will only be possible with the analysis of genetic material or the dental arch.
>
> According to the Civil Police, searches were made for dental records of appointments that Mari could have performed, however, no information was found that could contribute to the identification of the body.
>
> Given this, the police sought the assistance of the victim's family to collect genetic material, however, the family cannot afford to travel.

Mari's body was finally found on 9th July 2020 but not confirmed to be hers unti 1st April 2021 when the results of a DNA examination became avaaible.

She had been struggling to pay the rent and was being threatened with eviction.

> ALTOPASCIO. Her heart stopped beating yesterday morning at 10.30, at the burn center of the Cisanello hospital. The injuries, about eighty percent of the body, reported in the fire that she herself, according to first reports, caused, were too serious. A mad, desperate gesture, the epilogue of a difficult life, marked by very bitter experiences.
>
> According to her [birth certificate], Eduarda was born in Recife, Brazil, forty-one years ago. For years, nobody has been able to reconstruct how long, she was in Italy. She lived in Altopascio in an apartment building in via Torino. She was a transsexual girl; a shy girl who led her life in a very reserved way. Other trans girls who live in the same area knew her, but superficially, precisely because of her character and her choice of life. Perhaps she also avoided the difficulties she had to face every day, including economic ones. In March 2019 she had received an eviction notice: who knows if she had been able to fully understand what was reported in the document, written in terms of judicial jargon.
>
> She had never asked for help, though. Neither to the services of the municipal administration of Altopascio, nor to the Transgeneral Consultancy of Viareggio, the reference point of many girls like her. She had desperately tried to do it alone. Until the late morning of Monday 13 January, just before the bailiff rang the doorbell with the executive order for her eviction. In those last moments, in the awareness that she would lose even her only safe refuge, Eduarda was overwhelmed by despair. ""One way to kill a witch"" was her last message, at 12:39, on Facebook. She opened the gas pipes, the fire broke out, which undermined her life and endangered that of other tenants. Another twenty-four hours of agony, then it was all over.

She had been bound, gagged and had her head covered with a towel.

>
> Daily Mail Australia has been told that in her final moments, Ms McRae's arms were restrained behind her back with cable ties, and a towel had been wrapped around her head.
>
> The 69-year-old is believed to have been strangled to death.
>
> More than a month on from the horror murder, NSW homicide detectives are still hunting for Ms McRae's killer - dubbed the 'Coogee strangler'.
>
> A transgender woman who was also known by the name 'Sabrina', Ms McRae was a well-known identity around Coogee.

On 24th January a candlelight vigil was held to honour her memory.

> A candlelight vigil has been held to honour the memory of NSW woman Kimberley McRae, following her tragic death this month in Coogee in Sydney’s south-east.
>
> Police found the 69-year-old, who was transgender, dead in suspicious circumstances at her unit earlier this month.

>
> 'Isabella Lawson lays her soul bare in this intense and beautiful memoir. Lawson’s life is rich in experience, she’s pretty much tried everything and built an anthology that she articulates with bold poetic prose,' a description of the book read. 
>
> 'Maintaining a hopeful outlook without blame or regret she shines a spotlight on conservative Australia in the 60s, 70s, and 80s, the harsh values and gender repression and expectation.'

In March 2020 New South Wales police sought the extradition of a 20 year old Colombian student from the Caribean island of Aruba in connection with her murder.

> NSW Police are seeking the extradition of a man arrested in the Caribbean over the alleged murder of a Sydney woman earlier this year.

> The residents of the sector say that despite the smell they never thought it would be a body, they thought it was a dead animal. At 3:00 pm yesterday, after seeing the body, they decided to call the nearby GNB post. The military approached the site and were the ones who notified the Cicpc.

> Police authorities mentioned that, during the morning of Wednesday, some people found the victim, who was lying on the side of the aforementioned enclosure, located on Rua Francisco Javier Mina Oriente, at the height of the Barrio de la Cruz.

Angiie was a nurse. Her body was found without any identifying documents.

> Angiie Aguilera had studied nursing and was missing a year to receive it. “They shot her 14 times with bullets of different calibers. It makes me unfair that people like her are not supported, the truth is that we are in a very discriminatory world. Why did they get so mad at her, if she didn't mess with anyone? When they gave us her body, they said that she had no keys, no bag, no phone, that is, her personal things, they didn't give us anything. Neither her earrings, nor chains, nor [anything else]. They say the body was found with nothing,” Angiie's mother told Presentes.

Name Unknown,,,,,16-Jan-2020,,Frosinone,Lazio,Italy,41.62213,13.3249,uncategorised,not reported,"The victim was found dead in her apartment near Frosinone railway station. The cause of her death is not yet known.

> It is a mystery about the death of a 50-year-old [some reports say 30] transsexual woman of South American origin who was found dead at home in Frosinone. A neighbor called the police, suspicious after repeatedly knocking on the door.
>
> The agents, once inside, found the woman's body lying on the ground, lifeless. No signs of violence were found on the body. A tragic news that cannot exclude a priori the path of transphobia, as remarked by Francesco Angeli , president of Arcigay Rome.
>
> We learn in the press that a young trans girl has been found lifeless inside her apartment in Frosinone. It is important not to exclude in the investigations that it is a murder occurred due to transphobia. Italy in fact holds the sad record in Europe of murders due to transphobic hatred, and the many victims of recent years make us reflect on how much the theme of the security and isolation of trans people in our country is totally out of the interest of politics, which should represent everyone.
>
> Once again, moreover, some press reported the news narrating it in the male, as denounced on social media by Gianmarco Capogna.
>
> Still to ascertain many details of what happened, yet, the local press deemed it necessary immediately to focus on the victim's transsexual identity. An identity entirely narrated to men, ""a trans"", ""a young transsexual from Paraguay"". There are no certain details yet but if it were not an FtM (female to male) person, the entire narrative and the language used is completely wrong and disrespectful of the gender identity of the victim.
>
> Even in an article the possibility of violence against the victim is defined as "" homophobia "" and not transphobia.
>
> We can no longer accept that trans * people are increasingly victims of others.Victims of hatred, violence and social marginalization and victims of a wrong language, full of prejudices and stereotypes but, often, also of a lack of knowledge of the issues of the world t *. Specific training courses are needed, but above all a law is needed which, by filing the L.164 / 82, can truly free the trans * identities allowing their full recognition, the freedom and security they deserve.

An autopsy revealed that she had been raped, beaten and then strangled with an electricity cable.

On Monday 3rd February police arrested five people. Two more are thought to be at large.

> MAKAWANPUR, Feb 5: Dispute over the payment after sexual intercourse has led to the murder of a woman in Hetauda, police said on Tuesday.
>
> According to police, a group of youths killed Ajita Bhujel, 29, due to a dispute over the payment after having sexual relations with them inside a truck at Thana Bharyang in Hetauda, on January 17. Bhujel was transgender. 
>
> The gang had offered Bhujel Rs 7,000 for sex. Afterwards, the gang refused to pay the promised amount and strangled her to death in the truck using an electric cable, a police investigation has revealed. Afterwards they rushed to dump the dead body into a gorge along the Kanti Rajpath.
>
> Organizing a press meet in Hetauda on Tuesday, police made public the five accused. Chief of the District Police Office Sushil Singh Rathaur said five local youths were held in connection with the murder of the woman from Hetauda Sub-Metropolitan City-11. Police had traced the murderers through call details of the deceased person. During investigations, police had recovered the cell phone belonging to the deceased. 
>
> Two others involved in the murder are still at large, according to police. A joint team of the Metropolitan Police Crime Division, Teku and Makawanpur District Police Office had arrested the alleged murderers in a joint operation. Those arrested are Simon Pariyar, 18, Sushil Thapa Magar, 25, Ashish Bal, 24, Buddha Lama, 21, and Alisha Pakhrin, 20.

Like far too many trans women, Ajita was a sex worker not by choice but by necessity.

> Ajita Bhujel was a carefree and open person who always put her family first. Ever since her parents died when she was a child, Bhujel had been living with her grandparents and when she grew up, she became their sole source of support, both financial and emotional. But Bhujel wasn’t always comfortable in her body. She was 22 years old when she decided to transition from male to female, and although her grandparents were troubled at first, they came to accept her identity as a woman.
>
> But as a transwoman, Bhujel had trouble finding a job. She was forced to resort to sex work so she could keep supporting herself and her elderly grandparents.

> When Kiran Thapa, coordinator for the Blue Diamond Society in Hetauda, got a call from the police saying that a transgender woman had been murdered, she went into shock. But she collected herself and began calling everyone from the transgender community in Hetauda. Everyone answered, except for Bhujel. Thapa had known Bhujel for nine years. They were friends.
>
> “She worked as a rights activist in our organisation and we had a very good connection,” said a distraught Thapa, who is also transgender. “She used to call me ‘Aama’ and used to share everything with me.”
>
> Thapa, who immediately went to the site of the murder, described the scene as horrific. “The body seemed to have been thrown there and she was fully undressed,” she said. “Her gold ring and necklace were both missing. So was her phone.”
> 
> Although police refused to reveal details, Thapa said that the autopsy report showed that she had been raped before being struck on the head with a blunt object and then strangled to death by a wire. Police are uncertain about the motive behind the murder, but queer rights activists are concerned about the motive being a possible hate crime.

Her colleague survived but Hilary died in hospital.

> At almost 10:00 pm on last Saturday January 18, Hilary Medina, a 22-year-old trans woman, was with another young woman from the LGBTI community on the corner of a drugstore located [at the intersection of carrera 2 with calle 6] in the center of the city of Neiva (Huila).
>
> Everything seemed calm until two subjects who were riding a motorcycle arrived at the scene and one of them, without a word, fired indiscriminately against the two women.

> The brutal attack was captured by security cameras in the area. Her partner, meanwhile, was injured in the shoulder and is currently recovering in hospital.

Hilary had transitioned 5 years earlier and had a good relationship with her mother Claudia. Like far too many other trans women in Latin America, she had been forced into making a living as a sex worker.

> ""The discrimination we suffered was great. My daughter had a job of prostitution because she could never go to a school where she was received as the woman she felt herself to be. She could never access a decent job where they respected her [identity]. That's why many from them they choose that path, not because they want to, but because it is their turn; because there are no opportunities of any kind,"" Claudia said.
>
> “The day she left, I told her daughter very carefully; because you really know that they are exposed to many things on the street and more in that trade. It is difficult for a mother to know that her daughter was murdered without knowing why, I do not really understand what happened, ”said her mother as tears moisten her face.
>
> “My daughter's dream was to celebrate my birthday and buy me a house so I wouldn't continue paying rent. I just want to tell you something, never forget that transsexual, gay, lesbian or whatever people, are daughters, sisters, granddaughters because they have a family, and today it hurts us what they did to my daughter, because it was I who I had in my gut and I never cared what her sexual condition was, so I accepted it, ”concludes Claudia Jaramillo.

> ""The Dominican Republic, a country where being a [trans woman] is worse than being a dog on the street, because neither the State protects you and your relatives after death take away your breasts, hair and even put on men's clothes.

> ""What helplessness I have at this time and I only hope that your family pays for what they have done on earth.
