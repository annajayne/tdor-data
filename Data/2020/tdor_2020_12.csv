She died 2 days later.

> Last night during the exit with #AlaMilano's #Viadelcampo unit, we learned more about the Peruvian trans girl (China Rivera) who passed away on December 1, but we heard the news a few days later. She was one of our assistants but under a different name, it was really sad, we were in the car all amazed 😟

Her friends were unable to find out what had happened to her after she was admitted - possibly due to deadnaming by the hospital. They only became aware  of her death nearly two weeks later.

> My thoughts go to the Peruvian trans girl.
>
> We have learned very sad news.
>
> China Rivera, I wish you to rest in peace and guide us on our journey.

> Yesterday - December 13 / Antonia Monopoli: how can a Peruvian trans girl disappear into thin air (her worried family is in Peru)? It seems they took her to the emergency room of the San Raffaele hospital by ambulance, they declared she was in a coma but then nothing more was known about her. Her friends contacted the hospital but the hospital could not locate her.

She had been dead for around 7-10 days.

> A trans woman of Peruvian nationality who went missing about a week ago was found lifeless this Monday in an apartment in the Buenos Aires neighborhood of Balvanera, police sources reported.
> 
> The discovery of the body occurred after neighbors reported feeling nauseating odors from an apartment in a building located on avenida 2200 Corrientes. The asphyxiated trans woman, identified by her neighbors as Alejandra Salazar, was found by the Police in one of the rooms of the apartment marked by nauseating odors. She was lying on the floor next to a bed, naked and with a bag over her head.

> The 35th Criminal and Correctional Prosecutor's Office, headed by the prosecutor Ignacio Mahiques, ordered expert reports by the Criminalistics Unit and determined that the victim was a 54-year-old Peruvian national.
> 
> A police spokesman added that experts estimate the date of death to have been between 7 and 10 days earlier.

Alejandra was a Peruvian national. It was surmised that her killer was probably a client.

> Alejandra, a Peruvian national, had lived alone in that department for a short time. As Infobae learned , after much effort he finally managed to rent a place to live a little better. Perhaps for this reason, contact with the neighbors and the building manager himself was not very frequent and would partly explain why the victim remained dead for at least a week without anyone noticing. The woman was a sex worker and had been in Argentina for several years. The door to the home was not forced, so everything suggests that the murderer entered with Alejandra's consent. From the evidence found at the crime scene, it is assumed that the killer was one of her clients.

The La Rosa Naranja Civil Association, which supports and advocates for trans people, condemned the death of the woman through publications on social networks and demanded that justice be served.

> Infobae spoke with Marcela Tobaldi, founder of La Rosa Naranja: “Just in 2020, in our organization we already know of 105 deaths of transgender people. In 2019 there were 100 and in 2018 about 80. And they do not die because they are trans, they die because most of them [have to do sex work]. That leads to a fatal environment. Drugs, sexually transmitted diseases and violence”, assured the leader.
>

    All of the streets around here are No Standing zones.
    These pavements belong to the quick, and you move too slowly to follow.
 
    You slink along with a chaplet of roses about your orange hair,
    A sunset kaleidoscope visible only in flashes as I rush past.

    Today, I turned onto an unfamiliar street to find it empty and unhurried.
    Beyond the fibro houses, in among the scrub, I watched a ball of fire gently burning.

    I followed at a tiptoe, and lay down in that place until I was alone again.
    I am coming home with a flower tucked discreetly behind my ear.

Her colleague managed to escape, and although police found bloodstains at the crime scene and they were unable to locate Nataly's body.

> Nataly Lily's family and friends have been looking for her since Sunday night (13), when they learned that the woman, who is transsexual, could have been murdered. She was accompanied by a friend, who was shot and sent to the hospital Luzia de Pinho Melo, but was unable to say where the shooting took place.
> 
> ""My sister is an escort and does programs near a hotel in Jundiapeba. On Saturday, she went there and never came back. She was accompanied by a friend, who also does programs, and the two were invited by a couple, who paid in anticipation of a show"", said Luan Fortunato, the brother of the victim.
> 
> He explains that this friend said that Nataly was the one who talked to the couple initially and then invited her to participate. They got in the car and headed towards Avenida das Orquídeas. Customers reportedly said they were going to a party at a farm, but when they arrived, only Nataly got out of the car and was shot.
> 
> ""Her friend was still in the car and when she saw my sister she had already been shot. They had two other boys waiting in that place and they showed pictures, but they were not of my sister or of her friend. I believe that the attack was a mistake"", says Luan.
> 
> Even with the confusion, the friend was not spared being shot in the mouth and arm. After passing out, she woke up on top of Nataly and tried to wake her up, but thought she was already dead. The friend managed to run to a house in the Gica community, in the district of Braz Cubas. There, the Mobile Emergency Service (Samu) was called and she was referred to Luzia.
> 
> When she woke up in the hospital, the friend told her sister everything that happened and it was she who forwarded a voicemail to Luan telling what had happened. ""We already went looking for all the clues we had, we went close to Avenida das Orquídeas, in Parque Leon Feffer, but we didn't get anything. And the police aren't helping, they're not doing anything"", emphasizes the brother.
> 
> The São Paulo Public Security Secretariat (SSP) said only that the case was registered by the 2nd DP of Mogi das Cruzes as an attempted murder and disappearance of a person. They are investigating.

On 21st December family members held a protest to call for justice.

> A group of family members and friends of the transsexual Nataly Lily, 23, who has been missing since the 12th , is holding a protest late Monday afternoon (21), in front of Motel Mogi (formerly Paraná), on Avenida Lourenço de Souza Franco, in Jundiapeba, access between Mogi das Cruzes and Suzano. The road was blocked in both directions by the protesters at around 6:20 pm, complicating traffic on the stretch, which is quite busy at this peak time. 
>
> A team from the Mogi Municipal Guard arrived at the place around 6:50 pm and soon received reinforcements, but the protesters - who ""seek justice for Nataly"" - refused to clear the avenue. Military Police (PM) and Urban Ostensive Round (Romu) officers were called - heavily armed - who talked to the participants. One driver broke through the blockade, running over one of the protesters, causing bruises to one of their legs. Other drivers chose to use alternative routes. 
>
> Participants in the protest carried placards asking for ""justice"" for Nataly and dressed white T-shirts.  At 7:10 pm the occurrence was accompanied by three police vehicles and seven from the Municipal Guard of Mogi. In dialogue with the Protestants, the teams released a banner in each direction. The crowd started to disperse around 7:30 pm. Participants walked the route peacefully. 

In February 2021 a court ordered that the alleged assailants Vanessa Silva Vieira, Danilo Nascimento Batista (known as ""Cocão""), Caio Cleiton Rodrigues Silva (known as branquinho) and Carlos Renato Rodrigues Silva (known as ""Gó"") be detained in prison.

> Reports suggest that after Pugh was shot, party-goers waited 20 minutes before calling emergency services. Some did nothing, others took out their mobile phones and recorded.

> He was later charged with murder and two counts of second-degree assault – however, authorities said that they are not investigating Pugh’s death as a hate crime. Their family disagree with the decision.

> Tiffany believes Pugh “was killed because of what [they] was wearing, not because of who [they] was or what [they] did. I loved [them] with everything in me, that’s why [they] could shine like [they] did. Everything I had I poured into [Bella].”

> After thorough research, I could not find anywhere that he self-identified as a gender non-conforming or transgender person. There was one person who posted a tribute identifying Bella as transgender but that has since been refuted by multiple sources.
> 
> The whole idea behind the TDoR project which honors our dead is to investigate with integrity each individual and how they died. This is critical so that we may know who they were. Prior to the first TDoR, a trans-peer-led initiative, those who murdered us were arrested but never served jail time for their crimes.

On Wednesday 2nd December a school administrator had publicly humiliated her and and sent her home for wearing a skirt.

> [Deadname], a trans student from Lille France took her life on December 15, 2020, after being kicked out of class for wearing a denim skirt. In a video, filmed by [deadname] herself, we hear a woman, identified by the students as the CPE (Principal Education Advisor) at Fénélon high school, berate her. The exchange is tense.
> 
> “But I understand your desire to be yourself, I understand that very well! And all this is done to accompany you as best as possible, that’s what you don’t understand! Because once again he there are sensitivities that are not the same. ” [deadname], in tears, defends herself: “But it is they who must not be educated!” “I agree.” replies the adult. “I don’t see where the problem really is. I would never understand” concludes the young girl. The video has a photo where [deadname] is wearing a simple denim skirt, with the caption “I was dressed like this.”
> 
> On December 2, [Luna], a trans student, was sent home because she was wearing a skirt. The school administrator picked her out in class, humiliating her in front of everyone. She was taken to the CPE office where she was psychologically assaulted. It was made clear to her that she was not a “real woman” and that she could not wear a skirt. She was sent home.
> 
> Students say staff at Fénélon high school knew she was transgender. But they were afraid of how the public would perceive them if [deadname] was allowed to transition.

Some of her classmates knew her as Avril, some as Luna and some by her deadname. After her exclusion they protested by putting up posters and coming into class wearing skirts themselves.

> [Luna] lived in a foster home because her parents kicked her out when she announced her transition. She was completely accepted and felt good in her foster home.
> 
> On December 3, students from Fénélon high school put up posters in their high school to denounce this transphobic exclusion. The posters were removed the same day by the management.
> 
> On December 5, almost all of the students came in skirts to show her that they were completely supportive.
> 
> “Transphobia kills and it took away a friend of mine today. [Luna] I’m so sorry for everything they did to you. I fought by your side and I will continue to fight for you. You were a great person I’m glad I got to know you,” a friend of hers said on Twitter.

Luna was being supported by Association En-Trans Lille. She had started HRT four months earlier, was investigating laser hair removal and  intended to file for a change in her civil status in January. 

> Cyane Dassonneville, coordinator of the Users' Committee of the Trans health pathways, and Founder of the En-Trans Lille association, supported Avril in her transition. She had started, according to her, to take hormones four months ago, had approached a dermatologist for laser hair removal and intended to file for a change of civil status in January. With Cyane, she quickly brought up Luna's name, but was more inclined towards Avril. On the other hand, with her friends, she continued to use the first name given to her at birth. "" She was starting to talk about her new first name. She had told us about Avril, but preferred that we still call her by her first name "", said one of her friends.
> 
> "" She felt good in the class. Everyone accepted and integrated her "", continues Louise, another close relative. "" She was always smiling, when she was in a skirt she felt herself "", continues Zya, another non-binary friend. ""A fairly good student without being the first in the class, Luna liked to help her classmates, "" says Anouk. “ At the beginning of December, she felt confident enough to show up to class in a skirt. I think she had no idea how much violence she would receive in return. She had no intention of provoking, but simply of provoking. to be herself "", indicated her companion.

A suspect was arrested several hours after the discovery of her body.

> Early yesterday morning yesterday the authorities were notified about the discovery of a body next to a shopping center located in Costa del Silencio, within the municipality of Arona. Everything indicates that the death occurred at least two days before.
> 
> The scene that the specialists of the Civil Guard displaced in the vicinity of said shopping center, called El Chaparral, had to witness, was not pleasant for anyone.
> 
> On the ground was the lifeless body of a transsexual woman whose identity has only transcended that information, but nothing about her parentage or origin. Not only had at least 48 hours passed since the death had occurred, but the cause of death was obvious, although the last word in this regard always depends on the final results of the tests that make up an autopsy.
> 
> The corpse had wounds in the abdominal area compatible with an attack carried out with a knife. The number of possible stab wounds will be one of the unknowns revealed by forensic specialists from the Santa Cruz de Tenerife Institute of Legal Medicine.

Iratxe was of Colombian origin. Asociación TransGirls Canarias organised a crowdfunder help her family in Bilbao with funeral expenses.

> We don’t know how she died or why. We do not know the results of the autopsy. We do not know why her family published an accurate obituary, but still misgendered her in their personal content. We don’t know much about Kimberely at all because her social media was tightly locked down. Is the use of correct gendered language in her obituary an accurate description of her lived life? We know she was assigned a different traditionally male name at birth, a named shared with her father, and she went to court to legally change her name to Kimberely Patricia (note the unique spelling of Kimberely) and used Kim in everday matters.
> 
> We can say that most 40-year-old Black women don’t just die in parking lots at 6 AM. Does that mean she met with foul play – well, there’s not enough information for that conclusion either in spite of the mysterious truck. If her death was accidental or due to an overdose, those results from the coroner might take longer to come back

> El Centro Psico Trans de Quito and Asociación Silueta X, members of Plataforma Nacional Revolución Trans and the Federación ecuatoriana de Organizaciones LGBT, make the following public knowledge:
> 
> This December 28, 2020, HJ Ramírez, better known as La Tigra, was found dead at the gate of her house, located in Lomas de la Florida II, Guayaquil. La Tigra as they affectionately called her, 46 years old, was dedicated to the craft of sewing in the sector and was known for her kindness, cordiality and good heart by the locals.
> 
> Early this Monday, HJ Ramírez received a visit from an individual at her home at approximately 01:00 am. According to footage from the security cameras of a local neighbor, the subject was there close to an hour before running desperately out of La Tigra's home. In the morning, a client who was going to pick up her sewing found her lying down and lifeless near the door. Her body was stiff and bruised, and according to criminology data from the autopsy performed, HJ Ramírez died of asphyxiation - presumably by the individual who visited her and then rushed out of her home. The National Police continues in investigations.
> 
> We call on the authorities, especially the State Attorney General's Office and the National Police, to investigate the present case, regardless of whether or not the complaint is filed by the next of kin. Although it is true, it is known that, in the face of violent deaths, not clarified or suspected of criminality, the complaint is ex officio by the Prosecutor's Office, members of the Police, they mentioned that without a complaint there would be no investigations. This was reported to us by neighbors in the sector. Likewise, we invite the new Ministry of Government to provide us with answers about this and other murders, violent deaths, not clarified or suspected of criminality. Likewise, we request the Ombudsman's Office to monitor the due process initiated by the Prosecutor's Office.

Atlanta police said there were no signs of foul play, but people who knew her claim that she was killed during an argument.

> Friends and transgender advocates said Bonaire “Bonnie” Black was trying to find employment and housing. She was found dead on Dec. 31.
> 
> With fistfuls of pink and blue balloons – the colors of the transgender flag – friends gathered outside a drop-in center last week to memorialize Bonaire “Bonnie” Black, a transgender teen living on the streets who was found dead on New Year’s Eve.
> 
> The death of Black, 19, is under investigation by the Fulton County Medical Examiner’s office. There were no signs of foul play, according to an incident report from Atlanta police, but people who knew Black said she was killed during an argument.
> 
> Black was at least the fifth trans or gender non-conforming person to be killed or die under questionable circumstances in Georgia in 2020.
> 
> The body of Black, 19, was found on the third floor of the parking garage at the Georgian Terrace on Peachtree Street in Midtown, according to an incident report. An employee found her laying under a blanket with her fist clenched at about 2:30 p.m. on Dec. 31.
> 
> When a hotel manager and another employee couldn’t wake Black, they called police. A police report described the incident as a “natural death.” Officer Sharetia Thomas, the police officer who responded to the hotel’s call, wrote in an incident report that an employee of the medical examiner called to the scene “advised me there was no foul play.”
> 
> An investigator with the medical examiner’s office told Project Q Atlanta that an autopsy was performed but declined to discuss details of the investigation. It could be six weeks before a lab returns toxicology test results to the medical examiner’s office. 

Bonnie died just 7 days before her 19th birthday and was homeless at the time of her death. She was described by those who knew her as an artist, songwriter and rapper.

> “She loved doing her makeup and going out into the world making sure she looked her best,” Toni Bryce, a community health outreach worker with the National AIDS Education & Services for Minorities (NAESM), said during the event. “She was a young girl taken very soon,” she added.
> 
> Black was a client at Da Cribb, which NAESM operates, for more than two years, Bryce told Project Q. Staff at the facility last saw her on or about Dec. 28, she added.
> 
> Black was living on the streets at the time of her death and would sometimes sleep on Da Cribb’s porch, Bryce said.
> 
> “Every day we were open, she would come in and utilize the services we had,” she added.
> 
> Black was from Savannah and relocated to Atlanta at 17, according to trans activists. Bryce said she was trying to find a job and housing. But even facing difficult circumstances, Black still tried to help others in need.
> 
> “When she was trying to find housing, she was trying to help people. She was definitely always trying to help somebody else that was in her situation,” Bryce said.
