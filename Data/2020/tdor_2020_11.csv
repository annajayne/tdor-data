> Yesterday another transfemicide was known in Tucumán: Alejandra Benítez, a 34-year-old trans woman, was shot dead in the back on the sidewalk where she lived, on Avenida Roca and Ayacucho in the provincial capital. During the morning, the Homicide Prosecutor Unit No. 2 reported that a key witness had been testified. Witness accounts point to a man as the person responsible for the shooting.
> 
> ""The last we knew is that a guy got off the motorcycle, argued with her and shot her point blank,"" said Claudinna Rukone, a trans activist and friend of Alejandra. ""Apparently Alejandra was walking away when this person drew the weapon,"" says Lorenzo Franco, coordinator in Tucumán of the Association of Transsexual and Transgender Transvestites of Argentina (ATTTA).
> 
> The organization were with Alejandra's family on Wednesday. “I met Alejandra during the pandemic. She carried the needs of her companions on her shoulders and worked a lot with food parcels so that those who were having a very bad time did not lack, ”says Franco.
> 
> That of Alejandra Benítez is the second transfemicide in the province since the measures for the Covid 19 pandemic began . The previous one was that of [Vanesa Solórzano](https://tdor.translivesmatter.info/reports/2020/08/11/vanessa-solorzanorotolo_san-miguel-de-tucuman-argentina_96487107), a 20-year-old girl whose body was found in the Canal Sur area in San Miguel de Tucumán. Alejandra and Vanesa earned their daily living as sex workers, as did so many [trans women] who suffer structural violence and lack of access to basic rights. Neither of them reached the average age of life of a trans person in Latin America: 35 years.

Alejandra was one of the founders of [Trans Unidas](https://www.facebook.com/Trans-Unidas-Tucum%C3%A1n-104441481209094/), had a reputation for being cheerful and was well loved in her community.

> Alejandra Benítez was also Alejandra Power or, simply, La Power, as she was known around here. Among the younger trans women, they called her Godmother or Mother because she was the one who accompanied and advised them in the transgender transition process. “ In the neighborhood, the girls called her mom. She was a spokesperson and godmother for the younger trans. She cared for them and protected them. They were very companions of hers and now they are all destroyed, ”says Federico. Alejandra was a sex worker and one of the creators of the group Trans Unidas whose objective is to make visible all the demands and needs of the community of trans women in the province. During the pandemic, Alejandra helped collect merchandise for trans women from Tucumán. 
>
> “She had no problem with anyone, she shared with anyone, as long as they don't disrespect her. She has always been about improving herself, about traveling. She was in solidarity with everyone here, she never forgot that she comes from a humble neighborhood. The whole neighborhood is shocked by what has happened and we feel unprotected by the state. Politicians and judges leave much to be desired, those who represent us are killing us”, reflects Federico. 

In June 2021 Ricardo Puenzo was acquitted through lack of evidence.

> The trial for the transfemicide of Alejandra Estefanía La Power Benítez has concluded after a week of deliberations. Unanimously, the court comprised of Judge María Balcazar (president), Judge Rafael Marorito and Judge Isabel Menéndez, acquitted Ricardo Puenzo, the only accused of the crime.
>
> In their summing up, they pointed to the Public Prosecutor's Office, under the charge of prosecutor Carlos Sale, for deficiencies in the investigation that did not manage to gather enough evidence to determine with certainty that Puenzo was responsible for the six shots that killed the young trans woman or the four who injured Diego Mercado.
>
> “Unfortunately, due to the way in which this case was investigated, it is not possible to reach full certainty and conviction that Ricardo“ Ricky ”Puenzo was the author of the shots that caused the death of Alejandra Estefanía Benítez and injured Diego Ramos Mercado”, read Judge Menéndez in the public hearing followed by more than 100 people who were waiting attentively for the verdict.
>
> Mercado was a key witness of the trial and on whom the prosecution had relied for evidence to locate Puenzo, not only at the scene of the event, but as the material author of the crime, since he had affirmed this in the statements he gave to the prosecution. However, during the trial his testimony changed and he then maintained that when he was shot he was facing away and could not be sure who had fired.
>
> As a result, the court gave rise to the prosecution's request for Mercado to be investigated for false testimony.
>
> The magistrates launched strong criticism of the investigation of the incident, blaming the homicide prosecutor, Sale, and the police for having followed only one line of investigation and for having ruled out other lines of investigation, such as Benítez's ex-partner, for being a gender crime.

> The woman who was stabbed to death in a house in Utrecht at the beginning of this week is Özge Bilir, a 25-year-old transgender woman from Turkey. This is the first fatal transgender victim in the Netherlands this year, Trans United Europe confirms.
> 
> According to friends and relatives, the ex-boyfriend is the arrested suspect. The Dutch authorities do not want to say anything about it and talk about a good acquaintance of the victim.
> 
> In the Dutch trans and rainbow community, the violent death of Özge hit like a bomb. The same sad reactions could be heard on Facebook and Twitter. 'Not Ozge, surely? The Özge from Utrecht? That sweet spontaneous and cheerful woman, known for her fun live streams on social media? That happy party animal who just wanted people to laugh?'
> 
> Friends describe 25-year-old Özge Bilir as a resilient person whose boundless energy and tenacity allowed her to become who she wanted to become: an ambitious, strong woman.


Subsequently her ex-boyfriend Ilias A, 25, was sentenced to eight years in prison (with compulsary treatment for his addictions) for the crime of manslaughter.

> UTRECHT - 25-year-old Ilias A. from Utrecht has been sentenced to eight years in prison and tbs with compulsory treatment. Last November he stabbed his girlfriend with a knife during an argument in her apartment in Leidsche Rijn. The woman died of her injuries. The penalty is equal to the requirement of the Public Prosecution Service .
>
> The 25-year-old victim Özge Bilir was well-known within the transgender world. She was transgender herself and via social media she reported a lot about her transition. Her violent death sparked many sad and bewildered reactions.
> 
> The woman lived at Jan Wolkerssingel. She lived there in a sheltered housing. In the evening of November 10, she got into an argument with her friend Ilias A. He stated that he went to the kitchen to get a knife. He said that he made three striking movements towards his girlfriend. The third time he hit her.
>
> Two weeks ago, the Utrecht court zoomed in on the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim. They knew each other from high school and went down the wrong path together. A. and his girlfriend used a lot of drugs together. Although that worsened their relationship, the two continued to see each other. Even when the woman in Leidsche Rijn went to live in a protected housing on the Jan Wolkerssingel.
>
> The quarrels escalated to such an extent that A. received a restraining order. He smashed everything in her home and threatened her with a knife. A. was convicted for this, but it went wrong again last November. The two had used GHB and A. had been drinking and snorting cocaine. They again clashed, but this time resulting in a fatal stabbing.
>
> The suspect's lawyer asked for an acquittal because it could not be ruled out that the victim himself fell into the knife during the quarrel. In addition, it has not been proven that the suspect intentionally wanted to kill his girlfriend. The court acknowledges that there is no evidence that the man actually intended to kill his girlfriend.
>
> He has, however, been charged with 'conditional intent'. By making stabbing movements with a knife several times, at a short distance, he took the risk that he could kill the victim, according to the judge. On the basis of the statements of the suspect himself and the pathological examination, the court established that there was no question of an accident in which the victim himself was stabbed.
>
> The criminal lawyer also argued that it cannot be ruled out that the man had to defend himself against violence by the victim. Although the suspect was missing a tooth, the court does not agree with this either. A. has stated to the police that he no longer remembers when or how he lost this tooth. At the hearing, he said that he received a blow or kick during the argument with the victim, but it has not become clear when or why this happened. Moreover, A. has never stated that this was the reason for him to take the knife.
>
> On the basis of this, the court ruled that [murder] was not plausible and convicted the man of manslaughter. According to experts, the Utrecht resident has psychological problems, including an addiction disorder. In addition to the prison sentence of eight years and TBS with compulsory treatment, A. must pay the victim's mother compensation of more than 24,000 euros.

Özge's name was not included in the official TDoR 2021 memorial list released by Transgender Europe (TGEU) in November 2021.

> Soledad Rojas Paúcar (48), also known as Shisha, was murdered on November 12 in her “Rojas” mini-market located in block 19 of Mariscal Castilla, in the district of El Tambo, Huancayo, Sierra del Peru. They found her inside her premises stabbed in the neck and nape.
> 
> According to initial investigations, there had been a previous meeting at the victim's premises. Shisha did not appear to have resisted the attack, so it is thought that the perpetrator might have been someone known to her. The murderer stole her savings of approximately 7 thousand sols. Neighbors point out that despite the fact that the location is close to the Municipality, there are no surveillance cameras on the streets that could help to find Shisha's killer.
> 
> Shisha was a hard worker who was integrated into her community and well-liked. She used to sell mazamorras and chicha at local fairs and participated in local festivities as a tunantera (a typical dance in the region). During the pandemic, she had rented her premises to sell groceries.

Soledad is one of those remembered in [*""Resistiendo por Justicia""*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHSYsCWsATM) by *Proyecto Cancionar* (""The Song Project""):

> A group of feminist activists will join their voices in a collective song called ""Resistiendo por Justicia"", as a call for justice in the cases of gender violence that have taken place in the country. It will take the form of publicity both through social networks and artistic performances in public places.
>
> The 19 voices who will perform the song were selected after a call through social networks. As a result 10 musicians, a feminist [batucada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batucada), musical techniques and graphic artists will take part.
>
> The activists will meet and perform at 3pm [on 25th November] in Don Bosco Park in In Huancayo. At 6pm there will be a vigil in the Plaza de la Constitución.

However, some commenters have speculated that she may have been murdered and the killing disguised as a suicide. The news report at http://jornalipanema.com.br/n/?url=noticia%2Ftransexual-e-presa-em-sorocaba-suspeita-de-extorquir-dinheiro-de-prostitutas may well be related to this.

> Guys, was it really suicide?
>
> Because I was looking at her [facebook] and she posted a video of someone making threats. Was it not a murder made to look like a suicide?
>
> She was my sister's friend / client. I told her and she thought the same thing.
>
> Because she said she saw her 5 days ago, she was great because she had just had her chest done and had some aesthetic procedures... she was going to compete in miss trans and was at her peak.

Two women - including Kimberly - died from their injuries.

> Transgender woman Kimberly Fial, 55, was murdered on Nov. 22, in the Grace Baptist Church shelter where she volunteered. Wednesday the Santa Clara County Coroner’s Office identified Kimberly Fial as the second fatality in the stabbing attack that injured three other shelter volunteers.
> 
> San Jose PD press release identified the suspect as Fernando Lopez. He was arrested on 11/22/2020 by SJPD patrol Officers near the scene of the incident and remains in custody without bail.
> 
> On November 22nd, 2020, at approximately 7:54 PM, Officers responded to the Grace Baptist Church on the 400 block of East San Fernando Street on a report of a stabbing. When they arrived, they located five victims suffering from at least one stab wound each. An adult male victim was declared deceased at the scene. A second adult female victim was transported to a local hospital where she succumbed to her injuries and was declared deceased.

Kimberly had started volunteering at the shelter after arriving as a guest. 

> Ms. Fial arrived at Grace Baptist Church as a shelter guest in the middle of the year, and almost as soon as she got there, she started pitching in to help staff however she could, said shelter manager Anthony Mastrocola. That included helping make and serve dinner, passing out coffee in the morning, and running the shelter’s shower arrangements.
> 
> “My heart always felt warm when I saw her when I got into the building,” Mastrocola said. “One, I’m thinking ‘OK I know everything’s under control.’ And two, she’s just a good person.”
> 
> They also said she loved bright colors, and could usually be seen in hot pink shoes and colorful leggings, sipping a soda — her favorites were Coke and Dr. Pepper. And her quiet temperament belied her ability to draw a laugh out of people around her.
> 
> “She had a twinkle in her eye. This little smile,” said Shaunn Cartwright, who uses the church as a base for her homeless outreach efforts. “It was kind of like, ‘What are you up to?”

Chae’Meshia is just one of far too many black trans victims of gun violence in the USA. She will be sorely missed.

> “We are mourning Chae’Meshia along with her friends and family. Although I did not know Chae’Meshia personally, she was from my hometown, and her death impacts the trans and gender non-conforming community everywhere,” said HRC Director of Community Engagement for the Transgender Justice Initiative Tori Cooper. “We are continuing to see a devastating rate of violence against trans and gender non-conforming people in the United States, especially against Black and Brown trans women, and it must be stopped. It takes all of us to speak up and take action to end this violence.”
>
> Simms, who sometimes used the nickname “ChaeChae,” was close with her family and friends, and often posted photos of and with them on Facebook. Her loved ones are remembering her on social media as “good,” “kind” and “caring.” One friend remembered her as “one of my biggest supporters.” Many have expressed how much they will miss her.

She had been missing since Wednesday 25th November.

> OAXACA, Oax. (apro) .- The ""Rosario Castellanos"" Group of Studies on Women (GESMujer) expressed its outrage at the hate crime against Geovanna AR, 27, whose body was found this Tuesday in a ravine.
> 
> After demanding that the case be investigated under the femicide protocol, the president of GESMujer, Angélica Ayala Ortiz, pointed out the urgency of implementing investigations that lead to the sanction of violent murders based on gender orientation.
> 
> Geovanna, a trans woman, was reported missing since last November 25 in San Agustín, Etla. His body was found today in a ravine in the area ""El Campamento"", in Santiago Suchilquitongo.
> 
> This case, like that of 477 women and girls who have been violently murdered so far during the Alejandro Murat administration, is an outrageous example of the level of sexist violence and misogyny that persist in Oaxaca, stressed Ayala Ortiz.
> 
> It also considered that discriminatory expressions, acts of violence that materialize in hate crimes, serious human rights violations for reasons related to the sexual orientation, gender identity or expression of the victims, should be eradicated from society through of public inclusion policies that recognize the rights to sexual and gender diversity.
> 
> Because of her expression of being a woman she said Geovanna is one more victim of the omissions and negligence of the Oaxaca General Prosecutor's Office, since she was reported to the missing persons search unit, but they did not find her alive.
> 
> She highlighted that in 25% of the cases of 94 women murdered in a violent way so far this year, their corpses were abandoned in vacant lots, ravines, lonely villages, dirt roads, in the garbage dump, in clandestine graves or, as in in this case, in a dam. All represent a dehumanization of her body and, therefore, should be considered as transfemicide.
