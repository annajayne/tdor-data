In December 2007 Luis Garces was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to 28 years to life in prison.

>Yamile and her ex-boyfriend, named ""Luis,"" had serious relationship problems and he had just gotten out of jail where he was in custody for violating a restraining order. The ex-boyfriend had called Yamile that morning asking for a ride, but she had refused and told him not to call again. Not expecting the ex-boyfriend to come to the house, Janet was surprised when she heard Yamile screaming, ""you're killing me"" from the next room and saw Yamile being assaulted by a man she recognized from photos as Luis, the ex-boyfriend.
>
>The autopsy showed Yamile had died from a four-inch deep stab wound to the back of the neck which had severed her subclavian artery and penetrated the top of her left lung. No defensive wounds were found on Yamile.
>
> After retrial, a jury convicted Luis Manuel Garces of first degree murder (Pen. Code, § 187, subd. (a); count 1) and assault with a deadly weapon (§ 245, subd. (a)(1); count 2). The jury also found Garces had used a deadly weapon, a knife, during the murder (§ 12022, subd. (b)) and assault (§ 1192.7, subd. (c)(23)), and he had caused great bodily injury during the assault (§ 12022.7, subd. (a)). After denying a motion for new trial, the trial court sentenced Garces to a total prison term of 28 years to life and, among other things, imposed a $10,000 restitution fine under section 1202.4, subdivision (b).

Ali He'shun Forney,22,12-Apr-1975,1997_12_05_Ali-Heshun-Forney.jpg,https://www.nyclgbtsites.org/site/ali-forney-murder-location/,5-Dec-1997,tdor.info/5 Dec 1997/Ali He'shun Forney,East 131st Street,,New York,New York,USA,40.8091128,-73.9390995,violence,shot,"Ali was found with a gunshot wound to the head by police on the sidewalk in front of a housing project on East 131st Street in Harlem at 4 a.m. on 5th December 1997.

According to The New York Times at that time, Forney was the third young transgender sex worker murdered in Harlem in fourteen months. The killing has never been solved.

Over seventy people attended Forney's memorial service.

> When homeless teens die in New York City, a memorial service is held at a Times Square church.
> 
> Ordinarily, it is in a small sanctuary. But when 75 people--street kids, outreach workers and the Forney family--showed up, Ali's memorial was moved into the church's main sanctuary.
>
>  One by one, people paid tribute to Ali. Some called him Luscious.
> 
> Robledo, who still keeps Ali's lapsed life insurance policy in her desk, said some words. So did friends from Safe Space, which recently announced it will open a special home for transgendered youths, the Ali Forney House.
> 
> The year of his death, Ali had closed the talent show singing, ""God loves everybody for who they are."" At the service, Siciliano closed the book on his life saying the same words.

>
> Friends said that Ms. Williams, also known as Felicia, had worked as a police officer and
a nurse in Jamaica. Since coming to the U.S. she had worked in a bank and as a professional dancer in Manhattan. She had also worked as a [sex worker] after she lost her job in the bank.
